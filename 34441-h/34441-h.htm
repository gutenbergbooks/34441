<br /><i>MIDNIGHT AT THE GATE</i></h2>
<p>After a long, tiring climb, the two friends,
Penny Parker and Jerry Livingston, had reached the
summit of Knob Hill, far above the city of Riverview.</p>
<p>Now as they paused in the moonlight to catch their
breath, the slim, golden-haired girl bent to adjust the
irons of her skis before making a swift descent to the
clearing below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not have many more glorious skiing nights
like this one,&rdquo; she said regretfully. &ldquo;Anytime now,
the weather is due to turn warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, a reporter at the <i>Riverview Star</i>, nodded as
his gaze swept the snowy hillside, unmarked save for
the herring-bone tracks made by their own skis.</p>
<p>Tall and muscular, he was several years older than
Penny, who attended high school. The corners of
his mouth turned up slightly, giving him the appearance
of a semi-amused spectator of the world&rsquo;s goings-on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, it&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;This
will have to be our last run tonight. Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll race you to the valley!&rdquo; the reporter
challenged. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digging in their poles, they flashed off down the
hillside. Though they started together, Penny soon
forged ahead, descending the steep slope in graceful,
curving Christiania turns.</p>
<p>Beneath the mellow moon, snow crystals were brilliant
with light. Every pine bristled with glowing
icicles. Penny, feeling the rush of wind on her cheek,
drew in her breath and was glad to be alive.</p>
<p>With effortless ease, she swung her hips for the
sharp turns between the trees. Finally reaching the
clearing, she brought up with a spectacular jump-turn
and waited for Jerry who was close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting faster every trip!&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t a chance any more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed, and with her arm linked in his,
glided on to the fire where a group of noisy young
people were roasting wieners and boiling coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time you&rsquo;re getting back!&rdquo; declared Louise Sidell,
a dark-haired girl in heavy red woolen snowsuit.
She was on her knees in the snow, feeding hickory
chips to the cherry red fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>Louise considered Penny her dearest friend.
Though she would not have admitted it, she was
slightly green-eyed whenever another person claimed
any of her chum&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&mdash;m! That coffee smells delicious!&rdquo; Penny
cried, sniffing the fragrant aroma. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Jerry made their own sandwiches and
poured the steaming beverage. After they had finished
eating, the reporter suggested one last climb to
Knob Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly midnight,&rdquo; said Louise, before Penny
could accept. &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t we to be starting home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately a loud chorus of protest arose from
other members of the party. Penny looked at her
wristwatch regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to break up the party,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I
promised Dad I would be in fairly early tonight. Lou
and I will run along, and the rest of you stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home if you must leave,&rdquo; Jerry offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny has her car,&rdquo; said Louise quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
parked on the roadside just over the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Penny added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll ski down there and be
home in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid to go alone?&rdquo; Jerry asked
teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; The question caught Penny by surprise.
&ldquo;Why should we be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pass the old deserted Abbington
Monastery to reach your car. It&rsquo;s a spooky place at
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny arose and slipped her wrists through the
loops of her ski poles. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t put ideas into
our heads!&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just another building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t want me to go along?&rdquo; urged Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! Louise and I can handle any ghost
we&rsquo;ll meet tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls glided away, pausing at the top of the
slope to wave goodbye to their friends. Then they
shot down the hill on a trail which skirted a dense
grove of pine.</p>
<p>Ahead loomed the gloomy old Abbington Monastery,
a structure of moldy stone enclosed by a high
brick wall. To the right, inside the enclosure, was an
ancient graveyard, many of its white stones at rakish
angles.</p>
<p>Penny studied the building with keen interest as
she waited for Louise to catch up with her. Built generations
earlier, the property first had been used by an
order of Black Friars bound to the vows of poverty
and obedience.</p>
<p>Later, the monastery had been taken over by an
order of nuns, but as the buildings deteriorated, the
property had been abandoned. For ten years now,
it had stood unoccupied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ugly old place!&rdquo; puffed Louise, pausing beside her
chum to catch her breath. &ldquo;All the windows broken&mdash;why,
that&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; demanded Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows aren&rsquo;t broken! They&rsquo;ve been replaced!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the owner did it to save his property
from going completely to wreck and ruin. Wonder
who owns the place anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last I heard, it was sold at public auction for
taxes. I think a real estate man bought it for a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe he intends to fix it up for rent or
sale,&rdquo; Penny remarked. &ldquo;But who would want to
live in that ancient shell? Somehow, the place gives
me the creeps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise was staring hard at an upstairs window of
the distant building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I saw a moving light
just then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise pointed to the window high on the stone
wall of the monastery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;You must
have imagined it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not! The light is gone now. But I saw it
plainly. It may have been from a lantern. Someone
was moving from room to room!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a reflection of moonlight then.&rdquo;
Undisturbed, Penny removed her skis. Carefully
placing the running surfaces together, she threw them
over her left shoulder.</p>
<p>Far away, in the city of Riverview, a tower clock
began to chime the hour of midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; insisted Louise in a half-whisper. &ldquo;I did
see a light! Maybe the old monastery is haunted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hush!&rdquo; Penny silenced her. &ldquo;What are you
trying to do? Work up a case of nerves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just climb out of those skis and come on, my pet.&rdquo;
Penny moved briskly away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me!&rdquo; Frantically, Louise fumbled with
her ski irons. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me here alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then not another word about ghosts!&rdquo; Penny
chided.</p>
<p>However, she waited patiently until her chum had
removed the skis. The two girls then walked rapidly
toward the roadside where the car had been parked.
No longer could they see the friendly campfire in the
valley. As they drew closer to the monastery, towering
pines blotted out the moonlight.</p>
<p>Like a powerful magnet, the old stone building
drew their gaze.</p>
<p>Deep snow, glittering with an eerie blue lustre, lay
heavy on the high boundary wall. In the deserted
garden beyond the gatehouse, several statues also were
covered with soft white shrouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Louise clutched her chum&rsquo;s hand and urged her to
a faster pace.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, with one accord, the girls halted.</p>
<p>Directly ahead, at the front entrance to the monastery,
a big rusty gate stood slightly ajar!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s open!&rdquo; whispered Louise. &ldquo;Why, never before
have I seen that gate unlocked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant, Penny too was slightly unnerved.
But she replied steadily: &ldquo;What of it? Perhaps someone
has moved in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Louise watched uneasily, she walked to the
gate, fingering the rusty chain which dangled in the
snow.</p>
<p>Then boldly, she pushed the gate farther open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in there!&rdquo; Louise warned, her voice
sharp with anxiety. &ldquo;Please come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s ears were deaf to the plea. She stared intently
at a trail of footprints which led from where
she stood to a circular stone gatehouse only a few
yards away. The marks were very large and had
been made by a man&rsquo;s heavy boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but the words froze on her lips.</p>
<p>From inside the monastery came a shrill, piercing
scream. As the girls huddled together, the sound died
slowly away.</p>
<p>Then a silence, even more terrifying, fell upon the
grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>&ldquo;NO TRESPASSING&rdquo;</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Someone <i>is</i> inside that building!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed,
recovering from startled surprise.</p>
<p>Tensely, the girls waited, but the sound was not
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a woman&rsquo;s scream,&rdquo; Louise whispered after
a moment. Nervously, she clung to her chum&rsquo;s hand
as they stood in the shadow of the big iron gate.
&ldquo;What can be happening in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared at the dark monastery, uncertain what
to do. Nowhere was a light visible, yet she felt that
not only was the building occupied, but also that alert
eyes were watching them from somewhere in the
gloomy interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone may be in trouble and need help,&rdquo; she
said in an unsteady voice. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rap on the door and
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of night?&rdquo; Louise tugged at her
chum&rsquo;s hand, trying to pull her away. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,
Penny! It&rsquo;s really none of our affair what goes on
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But someone may be ill and in need of a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that type of scream,&rdquo; Louise replied with
a shiver. &ldquo;That cry gave me the creeps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny allowed herself to be pulled from the gate,
only to pause and gaze again at the darkened windows
of the ancient monastery.</p>
<p>The only daughter of a newspaper owner, she had
been trained to inquire the who, when, why, where,
and how of anything unusual. Penny never willingly
passed up an opportunity to obtain a good news story
for the <i>Riverview Star</i>. She knew that if the old
monastery were occupied after standing deserted so
many years, the readers of her father&rsquo;s paper would
be interested.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she reasoned, a scream from a darkened
house, always called for investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; she said with sudden decision. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
leave without trying to find out what&rsquo;s wrong here!
I&rsquo;m going inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny&mdash;please don&rsquo;t! This place is so far
from other houses. If anything should happen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something <i>has</i> happened,&rdquo; replied Penny grimly.
&ldquo;You wait here, Lou. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite her chum&rsquo;s protest, she returned to the big
iron gate, and pushing it farther open, stepped inside
the grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Intuition warned Penny to proceed cautiously. She
sensed rather than saw a dark figure crouching in the
arched doorway of the circular stone gatehouse to the
right of the snow-banked driveway.</p>
<p>Before she could decide whether the form was real
or a product of her imagination, a large, savage dog
darted from inside the gatehouse. His low growl
warned her it might be dangerous to attempt to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; Louise called anxiously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tear
you apart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though no coward, a second glance at the dog
convinced Penny that the animal had been trained to
guard the property. Rapidly, she backed away.</p>
<p>Her hand was on the latch of the gate, when in the
gatehouse doorway, she beheld a grotesque, deformed
human figure.</p>
<p>The sight so startled Penny that for an instant she
forgot the dog.</p>
<p>Plainly silhouetted against the gray stone was a hulk
of a man with large head and twisted back made unsightly
by a hump.</p>
<p>Though his eyes were full upon the girl, he remained
motionless, speaking no word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call off your dog!&rdquo; Penny said sharply.</p>
<p>Only then did the figure move from the doorway
into the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Bruno!&rdquo; he ordered in a rasping voice. &ldquo;Lie
down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>As the dog obeyed, Penny caught her first plain
glimpse of the deformed man&rsquo;s face. His skin was
heavily lined and fell in deep folds at his stocky neck.
But it was the dark, intent eyes which sent a shiver
down her spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; she said uneasily.</p>
<p>The gateman did not respond to the greeting. Instead,
he demanded gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you doin&rsquo; on this property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I was only investigating because the gate
was unlocked,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the
house was occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it now. See that sign!&rdquo; The gateman
turned on his flashlight, focusing it upon a freshly
painted placard tacked to a nearby tree.</p>
<p>The sign read, &ldquo;No Trespassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny apologized, but stood her
ground. &ldquo;Are you the new owner of this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m the gateman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who has taken over the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo; the hunchback demanded unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is being turned into an institution,&rdquo;
the hunchback informed her. &ldquo;The new owner
moved in yesterday. Now git along, so I can lock the
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The gateman&rsquo;s eagerness to be rid of her made
Penny all the more determined to remain until her
curiosity was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I fancied it,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but a moment
ago, I thought I heard a shrill scream from inside the
building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have heard the howl of the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wind?&rdquo; Penny inquired pointedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
comparatively quiet night.  I distinctly heard a
scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you got better ears than I have,&rdquo; the gateman
muttered. &ldquo;Will you go now, or do you want me to
call the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grumbling to himself, the hunchback stepped into
the gatehouse and pressed a button which rang a bell
inside the building.</p>
<p>A light went on in a downstairs room, and a moment
later the front door opened. Framed on the threshold
stood a very tall man in dark, hooded robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Winkey?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;You rang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl here wants to see you,&rdquo; shouted the
hunchback. &ldquo;She says she heard a scream and wants
to know how-come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treading lightly in the loose snow, the thin man
came down the driveway to the gate. His long, brown
robes were impressive, his demeanor pious. Penny
suddenly felt very foolish indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything wrong?&rdquo; he asked in a kindly, silken-smooth
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to get in,&rdquo; announced Winkey.
&ldquo;Says she heard a scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hooded monk studied Penny with an intent
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live near here?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Riverview. I was out skiing with a few friends
when I passed this old building and heard the scream.
Your gateman tried to tell me it was only the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, doubtlessly you did hear a scream,&rdquo; the
monk replied. &ldquo;It was Old Julia, a poor woman, who
unfortunately sometimes becomes disturbed in her
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a mental institution?&rdquo; gasped Penny, regretting
that her curiosity ever had taken her inside
the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child,&rdquo; responded the monk. &ldquo;Winkey
should have explained. We have opened up the old
monastery for the purpose of restoring an ancient
order in which members dedicate themselves to a life
of poverty, good will, and charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you call Old Julia&mdash;she also is a member?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk sighed deeply. &ldquo;Old Julia is only an
unfortunate whose twisted mind never can be healed
by doctors. Because she had no home&mdash;no friends, I
have taken her beneath my roof.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to have
troubled you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A natural mistake, my child. Is there anything
else you wish to know? We have no secrets here&mdash;only
serene faith and hope for a better world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might inquire your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Members of my flock call me Father Benedict.
My baptismal name is Jay Highland. And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker. My father owns the <i>Riverview
Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A newspaper?&rdquo; The monk&rsquo;s inquiry was sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best in the city,&rdquo; Penny said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father sent you here, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I was just passing by and noticed the
buildings were occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; murmured the monk. &ldquo;I trust you
will use discretion in mentioning our work here.
Should we become too well known, a path will be
beaten to our door, and the privacy of our order will
be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scarcely mention it,&rdquo; Penny half-heartedly
promised. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retreating through the gate, she closed it behind
her.</p>
<p>A few paces away, Louise, who had heard only part
of the conversation, waited in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were those men?&rdquo; she demanded, falling into
step with her chum. &ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Penny repeated everything Jay Highland had told
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed rather nice,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;But when
you sum it up, he didn&rsquo;t tell much about the order he
is founding here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he explained that. It seems an old woman
named Julia lives in the institution. She&rsquo;s demented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a nice place!&rdquo; The girls now had reached
the car and Louise stood aside for her chum to unlock
the door. Quickly they stowed their skis and poles in
the rear and then Penny started the motor which
popped and sputtered in the frosty air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing again,&rdquo; she observed, switching on
the windshield wiper. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get started a minute
too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the girls had traveled a quarter of a mile,
huge, wet flakes pelted the glass. Once as the wiper
stuck, Penny had to get out and clear the windshield
with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really getting awful!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as
they drove slowly on along the narrow, curving country
road. &ldquo;I can hardly see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Louise warned a moment later.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re close to the ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny brought the wheels back onto the main track.
But a dozen yards farther on, she saw directly in her
path, a bent figure struggling along under the weight
of a heavy suitcase. Her head was held low against
the wind and snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Unaware of the approaching car, the pedestrian was
walking almost in the center of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Penny!&rdquo; screamed Louise as she too saw
the girl with the heavy burden. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll run her
down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>STRANGER OF THE STORM</i></h2>
<p>Penny swerved the steering wheel, missing the
girl by inches. Somewhat shaken by the near-accident,
she pulled up at the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, that was close!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise. Lowering
the side window of the coupe, she gazed curiously at
the snowy figure, plodding through the drifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to offer her a lift to Riverview,&rdquo;
said Penny. &ldquo;Whoever she is, she shouldn&rsquo;t be walking
alone at this time of night&mdash;and with a heavy suitcase
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But should we pick up a hitchhiker, Penny? It
might not be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to do it as a rule, but this is different.
It&rsquo;s storming hard and she looks about our age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debating no longer, Penny thrust her head through
the window opening and called: &ldquo;Want a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The girl with the suitcase had moved into the glare
of the headlights. She turned toward the car with a
startled expression. Penny and Louise saw that she
was thinly clad in a light weight coat, and wore no
galoshes.</p>
<p>To their astonishment, the girl shook her head and
kept on walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s more afraid to ride with us than we were to
pick her up. She may not realize we&rsquo;re just a couple
of school girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shouldn&rsquo;t be out in this storm dressed as she
is,&rdquo; declared Louise, now concerned for the stranger.
&ldquo;Ask her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shifted into low gear and pulled alongside.
&ldquo;Please, can&rsquo;t we give you a lift into the city?&rdquo; she
urged.</p>
<p>The girl stopped then, resting her suitcase in the
roadway. A breath of wind swept a lock of dark hair
across her thin face. Impatiently she brushed it aside
and murmured: &ldquo;No, no, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny would have driven on, but the voice held a
hint of tears. It occurred to her that the girl might be
running away from home&mdash;certainly she was bewildered
and in trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This snow is
coming down heavier every minute. Of course, you
want a ride.&rdquo; She flung the car door wide open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>A moment longer the girl hesitated. Then without
a word, she swung the suitcase into the automobile and
squeezed in beside Louise. However, she scarcely
glanced at the girls, but centered her sober gaze on the
snowflakes which danced across the windshield.</p>
<p>The car moved ahead. &ldquo;Going far?&rdquo; inquired
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Penny twisted her head sideways
to stare at the girl. She started to ask a question,
then thinking better of it, remained silent.</p>
<p>Louise, however, could not allow the odd reply to
pass unchallenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you must know where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you mean you have no home, or are
running away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a home,&rdquo; the girl replied shortly. &ldquo;I only
meant I haven&rsquo;t decided where I&rsquo;ll go or what I&rsquo;ll do
when I reach Riverview. That&rsquo;s the name of the
closest place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded. &ldquo;Apparently, you come from some
distance away,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>The girl made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we introduce ourselves?&rdquo; said Louise, determined
to learn the stranger&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;This is Penny
Parker, and I&rsquo;m Louise Sidell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only by a brief nod did the girl acknowledge the
introduction. She did not volunteer her own name.
Her failure to do so, obviously was deliberate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live near here?&rdquo; Louise inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>The stranger squirmed uncomfortably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like answering questions.
That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to accept a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise took the reply for a rebuke. &ldquo;I certainly
didn&rsquo;t mean to be personal,&rdquo; she returned stiffly. &ldquo;Excuse
it, please. Dreadful weather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The topic fell flat. No further attempt at conversation
was made.</p>
<p>Penny kept close watch of the road, for the heavy,
wet snow made visibility very poor. She was greatly
relieved when they reached the outskirts of the city
and a wide boulevard which followed the curve of the
frozen river.</p>
<p>Seeing the lights of Riverview, the strange girl began
to watch the streets intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let me out anywhere,&rdquo; she said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere?&rdquo; Penny repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we pass the river docks on this road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the next turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me off there, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river docks!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise. &ldquo;At this
time of night? No boats are running and there are no
houses or business places close by. Only deserted fish
houses and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, that&rsquo;s where I want to get off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise gave up trying to figure out their
strange passenger. At the next turn in the road, they
pulled up near a dimly lighted street corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The girl opened the car door and reached for her
suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the ride,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry if I seemed rude and unfriendly. There are
things I can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny or Louise could answer, the car door
closed firmly in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like that?&rdquo; the latter demanded
furiously. &ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t a cool cucumber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be running away from home,&rdquo; Penny said,
frowning. &ldquo;Why otherwise, would she refuse to tell
her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did she insist in getting out on this corner,
of all places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad section of town, Louise. No one seems
to be about, but even so, a girl shouldn&rsquo;t be wandering
around here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to warn her. She seemed to know what
she wanted to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I feel sort of responsible,&rdquo; Penny returned
uneasily. &ldquo;I hope nothing happens to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the car, the girl walked toward the
river. Now at the corner, she paused beneath a street
light, and glanced back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s waiting for us to go on!&rdquo; Penny guessed
shrewdly. &ldquo;For some reason, she doesn&rsquo;t want anyone
to know where she&rsquo;s going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s wait and watch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll learn nothing that way. She can tell we&rsquo;re
keeping our eye on her.&rdquo; Penny threw in the clutch
and the car rolled away from the curb. &ldquo;Tell you
what, Lou! We&rsquo;ll drive around the block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; approved her chum. &ldquo;That way
she&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;ve gone and we can see where she
really goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned at the first corner and made a quick
trip around the block. As they again came within
view of the ice-locked river, the girls looked quickly
up and down the street for a glimpse of their former
passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; Louise cried. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s walking
straight to the docks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls now were completely mystified and
not a little worried. At this late hour, the waterfront
was deserted.</p>
<p>Penny watched the retreating figure for a moment,
and then swung the car door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl can&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our pains, we may be told to mind our own
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beside the point, Lou. Something&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without taking time to lock the car, the two girls
hurried down the dark street toward the docks. Far
ahead they could see the one they pursued walking
swiftly. Then in the blinding, whirling snow, they
lost sight of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Reaching the waterfront, Penny and Louise gazed
about in disbelief and bewilderment. The girl had
vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where could she have gone&mdash;&rdquo; Penny murmured,
only to break off as her gaze fell upon a trail of
footsteps.</p>
<p>The prints led along the dock for a short distance,
only to end at the river&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>VANISHING FOOTPRINTS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That crazy girl must have jumped off here!&rdquo;
Louise exclaimed, as she too saw the footprints on the
snowy planks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river is solid ice&mdash;at least six inches thick,&rdquo;
Penny pointed out. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have crashed
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far upstream toward the Main Street Bridge, an
iceboat could be seen tacking back and forth. Otherwise,
the river was a gleaming ribbon of deserted ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only place she could have gone is under the
dock,&rdquo; Penny said, her eyebrows knitting into a puzzled
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Under</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she must have done,&rdquo; Penny insisted.
&ldquo;I suppose the planking would give some protection
from the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The snow was coming down harder now than ever,
in huge flakes. Trailing the footprints to the dock&rsquo;s
edge, Penny flattened herself on the planks and peered
over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing!&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;Dark as
pitch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Louise.</p>
<p>Both girls became quiet. Distinctly they could hear
a faint creak of snow as someone walked beneath the
dock, a long distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, down there!&rdquo; shouted Penny.</p>
<p>The creaking sound ceased. But no one answered
the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s down there, she&rsquo;ll never answer!&rdquo; Louise
said, thoroughly disgusted. &ldquo;Should we go after her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was sorely tempted. She studied the long,
high dock only to shake her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If once we get down there, we couldn&rsquo;t climb up
again without walking a long distance, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call the police station,&rdquo; Penny urged. Scrambling
to her feet, she brushed snow from her ski suit.
&ldquo;This is a case for them to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; agreed Louise, greatly relieved.
&ldquo;I know my parents wouldn&rsquo;t want me prowling
under the docks at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Pelted by fast falling snow, the two friends returned
to the parked car and then drove to a drugstore several
blocks away. Penny telephoned Central Police Station,
only to be informed a car could not be sent to
the river for a few minutes. Heavy snow had snarled
traffic, causing many accidents and tying up police
personnel.</p>
<p>For twenty minutes the girls waited patiently in
their car, but no one came to investigate. At last,
giving up in disgust, they drove to their homes.</p>
<p>Try as she would, Penny could not forget the
strange girl with the suitcase who had been so unwilling
to answer questions. Who was she? And
why had she taken refuge beneath the river docks?</p>
<p>She longed to talk the matter over with her father,
but Mr. Parker had gone to bed early.</p>
<p>Penny kept thinking about the matter until she fell
asleep and it was foremost in her thoughts when she
awoke in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if the <i>Riverview Star</i> carried any mention
of a police investigation at the river?&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<p>Dressing rapidly, she ran downstairs to bring the
morning paper in from the porch. Eagerly she
scanned the pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single word here!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disappointment.
&ldquo;Maybe the police didn&rsquo;t even bother to
search the dock area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make certain, she telephoned Captain Brownell,
a personal friend at Central Station. The officer explained
that a police car had been dispatched to the
river shortly after one o&rsquo;clock. Footprints noted
earlier by the two girls, had been blotted out by falling
snow. No one had been found loitering in the area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; sighed Penny, turning away
from the telephone. &ldquo;I wish now, Lou and I had
taken a chance and prowled under the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the breakfast alcove, Anthony Parker, a tall,
lean man with iron gray hair and intelligent eyes, regarded
his daughter in amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking to yourself again, Penny?&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; Penny slid into a chair beside her father
and reached for a tall glass of orange juice. &ldquo;The
things I&rsquo;m thinking about the police department aren&rsquo;t
complimentary either! What this town needs is a
larger force and at least a dozen extra patrol cars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could find plenty of work for them, I judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I? A nice situation when police are too
busy to investigate an important call promptly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they gave you the run-around,&rdquo; teased Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;Suppose you tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting at the very beginning, Penny told of hearing
the strange cry at the old monastery and later, the
meeting with the unfriendly girl who had disappeared
near the river docks.</p>
<p>While she related her odd experiences, Mrs. Maud
Weems, the family housekeeper, came in bearing a
platter of scrambled eggs. Since the death of Penny&rsquo;s
mother, the woman had cared for the girl as her own
daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>She listened attentively to the tale of adventure, and
with obvious disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, that&rsquo;s what comes of midnight
skiing parties!&rdquo; she interrupted the story. &ldquo;I hope
you stay away from Knob Hill and the monastery
after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s elfin face lost a little
of its excited glow. &ldquo;This wonderful skiing weather
can&rsquo;t last many days! I simply must go back there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ski or to investigate the monastery?&rdquo; asked the
housekeeper. &ldquo;If I know the signs, you&rsquo;re hot on the
trail of another mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally I want to learn more about that strange
cult,&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;Who knows, I might track
down a bang-up story for Dad&rsquo;s paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skiing always seemed a wholesome sport to me,&rdquo;
interposed Mr. Parker, winking slyly at his daughter.
&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t approve of late hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems sighed as she set the egg platter down
hard on the table. &ldquo;You two always conspire against
me!&rdquo; she accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; Penny observed innocently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you approve of skiing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skiing is only an excuse and you know it, Penelope
Parker! Oh, dear, I try so hard to raise you properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re doing a magnificent job, if I do say
so myself,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give the matter
any further thought!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny always has proven she uses her head and
knows how to take care of herself,&rdquo; added Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;An inquisitive mind is an asset&mdash;especially in the
newspaper business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an injured sniff, Mrs. Weems retreated to the
kitchen to wash the dishes.</p>
<p>Alone with her father, Penny grinned at him affectionately.
His defense of her conduct meant only
one thing! He did not disapprove of her interest in
the monastery at Knob Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s giving me the &lsquo;go&rsquo; signal!&rdquo; she thought jubilantly.
Aloud she said. &ldquo;Dad, don&rsquo;t you think Jay
Highland and the monastery might be worth a feature
story in the <i>Riverview Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; he agreed, getting up from the table.
&ldquo;Well, I must move along to the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little disappointed because her father had brushed
the subject aside so lightly, Penny spent the morning
helping Mrs. Weems with household tasks. However,
directly after luncheon she packed her skis and
prepared to set off for Knob Hill.</p>
<p>Unwilling to go alone, Penny stopped at the Sidell
home. To her disappointment, Louise had gone shopping
and was not expected back for several hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can induce Dad to go with me!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;He spends entirely too much time indoors.
An outing will do him good!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>At the <i>Star</i> plant in the heart of downtown Riverview,
Penny wandered through a nearly deserted editorial
room to her father&rsquo;s office. For a morning paper
the hour was early, and few reporters had as yet
unhooded their typewriters.</p>
<p>Through the glass door Penny observed that her
father had a visitor, a middle-aged, intelligent looking
man she had never seen before. She would have
slipped away had her father not motioned for her to
enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, this is James Ayling, an investigator for
the Barnes Mutual Insurance Co.,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
daughter, Mr. Ayling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor arose to grasp the girl&rsquo;s hand firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling is from Boston,&rdquo; explained the newspaper
owner. He turned to the investigator. &ldquo;Do
you mind if I tell my daughter why you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling is trying to locate an elderly woman
whose family jewels are heavily insured with his company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne isn&rsquo;t actually our client,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;Originally, old Nathaniel Hawthorne,
her late husband, insured a $100,000 star sapphire
with us. The policy remains in effect until the
gem becomes the possession of a granddaughter,
Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has the sapphire now?&rdquo; asked Penny, slightly
puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawthorne&rsquo;s will allows his wife the use of it
during her lifetime. Upon her death it passes to the
sixteen-year-old granddaughter, Rhoda Hawthorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are searching for Mrs. Hawthorne now?&rdquo;
Penny inquired politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so far as we know Mrs. Hawthorne has the
gem. We are afraid it may be stolen from her or that
she will dispose of it for a trifling sum. Mrs. Hawthorne
hasn&rsquo;t been well and in her present state of
mind she might act very foolishly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Penny about the gem&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! The sapphire once was set in a necklace
worn by a king who met violent death. Since then,
there is a superstition that bad luck pursues the owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gem passed through many hands. Three
times it was stolen. Several owners died strange or
violent deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mr. Hawthorne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he fell from a cliff while touring the West,&rdquo;
explained the investigator. &ldquo;Of course it was an accident,
but Mrs. Hawthorne unfortunately became convinced
his death resulted from ownership of the sapphire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She pleaded that the gem be sold for what it would
bring, fearing that harm would come upon her grandchild
when eventually the sapphire is turned over to
her. According to terms of the will, the gem cannot
be sold, and our firm must remain responsible for it
in case of theft or loss.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne still has the gem then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling replied. &ldquo;She went
South on a vacation trip with her granddaughter, taking
the sapphire with her. That was over a month ago.
Nothing since has been heard from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what brings you to Riverview?&rdquo; questioned
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went South searching for Mrs. Hawthorne. At
Miami only a week ago she bought two tickets for
Riverview. From that point on, I&rsquo;ve been unable to
trace her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she have relatives or friends here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I&rsquo;ve been able to learn. Perhaps our
company is unduly concerned, but the truth is, Mrs.
Hawthorne is a very foolish, gullible woman. Should
she dispose of or lose the gem, our firm must pay a
large sum of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to run a picture of Mrs. Hawthorne
in the paper,&rdquo; offered Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If she has arrived
in Riverview, someone will have seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly appreciate your interest,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ayling. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I have no photograph of
Mrs. Hawthorne with me. I&rsquo;ll wire my office tonight
for one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll run a little story,&rdquo; the
publisher promised. &ldquo;No doubt you can describe the
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, in a general way. She&rsquo;s 68 years of age
and walks with a cane. Her hair is white and she
weighs about 150 pounds. She&rsquo;s deeply interested in
art. Also in spiritualism and mystic cults, I regret to
add.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystic cults!&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s blue eyes began to dance
with interest. She knew now why her father had
made a point of calling her in to meet the investigator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne is very gullible and easily influenced.
Since her husband died, she has been prey for
one sharper after another. I judge a third of her fortune
already has been squandered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a thoughtful pause, Penny hesitantly asked
Mr. Ayling if he thought it possible Mrs. Hawthorne
could have come to Riverview to join a cult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to find out. Mrs. Hawthorne
and her granddaughter have not registered at any of
the leading hotels. Yet I know they came to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried the monastery at Knob Hill?&rdquo;
Penny suggested. &ldquo;A new society has been established
there in the last few days. I don&rsquo;t know much about
the order yet, but its members are supposed to dedicate
themselves to a life of charity and poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s exactly the sort of thing to attract
Mrs. Hawthorne&mdash;for a few weeks,&rdquo; the investigator
replied. &ldquo;Then after the novelty wore off, she would
flit on to something else. Where is this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plan to drive out there in a few minutes,&rdquo; Penny
told him eagerly. &ldquo;Why not come with me, Mr.
Ayling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The investigator glanced inquiringly at Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead if you think it&rsquo;s worth while,&rdquo; urged
the publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the chance of finding Mrs. Hawthorne
there is very remote,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling said, thinking aloud.
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t afford to overlook any possibility.
Thanks, Miss Parker, I&rsquo;ll gladly accept your invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come along, Dad?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; he declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll be
in good hands. Just let Mr. Ayling take the lead in
any investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad!&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;You know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker, smiling as he resumed
his desk work. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I feel confident
Mr. Ayling may look forward to a very interesting
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>A CRYSTAL BALL</i></h2>
<p>Pine trees and bushes hung in frozen arches along
the winding road which led to the ancient monastery.</p>
<p>Parking the automobile near the iron boundary
fence, Penny was quick to note that the big ornamental
gate now was locked and securely fastened
with chain and padlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure this place is occupied?&rdquo; Mr. Ayling
asked as he alighted and followed Penny to the gate.
&ldquo;Why, the property is a wreck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate was unlocked last night,&rdquo; the girl replied.
&ldquo;We may have trouble getting inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressing her face against the rusty iron spikes, she
gazed hopefully toward the gatehouse. The door was
slightly ajar. Winkey, however, was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>Mr. Ayling rattled the gate chain several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one seems to be around,&rdquo; he said in disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is!&rdquo; Penny corrected.</p>
<p>Just then she caught a fleeting glimpse of a face at
the tiny circular window of the gatehouse. She was
convinced it was Winkey, who for some reason, intended
to ignore their presence at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Ayling.</p>
<p>Still there was no rustle of life from the gatehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; Penny muttered. &ldquo;I know Winkey
is watching us! He&rsquo;s only being contrary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ayling&rsquo;s angular jaw tightened. &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to get in the best way we can.
I&rsquo;ll climb over the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words purposely were spoken loudly enough
to be overheard in the gatehouse. Before the investigator
could carry out his threat, the door of the circular,
stone building swung back. Winkey, the hunchback,
sauntered leisurely out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear us trying to get in?&rdquo; Mr. Ayling
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the hunchback shrugged, &ldquo;but I was busy
fixin&rsquo; the bell that connects with the house. Anyhow,
visitors ain&rsquo;t wanted here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we observe,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;Where is your
master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then announce us,&rdquo; the investigator ordered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to ask a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winkey&rsquo;s bird-like eyes blinked rapidly. He looked
as if about to argue, then changed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on to the house then,&rdquo; he said crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let &rsquo;em know by phone you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driveway curled through a large outer courtyard
where a cluster of small and interesting buildings
stood in various stages of ruin.</p>
<p>Near the gatehouse was the almonry, a shelter used
in very early days to house visitors who sought free
lodging.</p>
<p>Beyond were the ancient brewhouse, bakehouse,
and granary. The latter two buildings now were little
more than heaps of fallen brick. None of the structures
was habitable.</p>
<p>In far better state of preservation was the central
building with gabled roof and tall hooded chimneys.
However, front steps long since had fallen away from
the entrance doorway. Bridging the gap was a short
ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a place!&rdquo; commented Mr. Ayling offering
Penny his hand to help her across. &ldquo;Looks as if it
might cave in any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitors found themselves facing a weather-beaten
but beautifully carved wooden doorway. Before
they could knock, it opened on squeaky hinges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>A woman with heavily lined face, who wore a gray
gown and white lace cap, peered out at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she murmured in a stage whisper. &ldquo;Go
quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia!&rdquo; said a voice directly behind her.</p>
<p>The woman whirled around and cringed as a
brown-robed monk took her firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and light a fire in the parlor, Julia,&rdquo; her master
directed. &ldquo;I will greet our guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father Benedict,&rdquo; the woman muttered, scurrying
away.</p>
<p>The master now turned apologetically to the
visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust my servant was not rude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor
creature! Her twisted mind causes her to believe that
all persons who do not dwell within our walls are evil
and to be feared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the monk spoke, he smiled in a kindly, friendly
way, yet his keen eyes were appraising the two visitors.
Though it was cold and windy on the door
step, he did not hasten to invite Penny and Mr. Ayling
inside. He stood holding the half-opened door in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse our lack of hospitality,&rdquo; he said,
fingering a gold chain which hung from his thin shoulders.
&ldquo;We have much cleaning and remodeling to do
before we are ready to receive visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Mr. Ayling explained that his call was one of business,
adding that he represented the Barnes Mutual
Insurance Co.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such matters must be discussed with me later,&rdquo; the
monk said, slowly but firmly closing the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not selling insurance,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling assured him.
Deliberately he leaned against the jamb, preventing
the monk from shutting the door.</p>
<p>Father Benedict bit his lip in annoyance. &ldquo;May I
inquire your business with me?&rdquo; he asked frostily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeking to trace a client&mdash;Mrs. Nathaniel Hawthorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no such person. Deeply I regret that I
cannot help you, sir. If you will excuse me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman may have used an assumed name,&rdquo;
Mr. Ayling cut in. &ldquo;She has a weakness&mdash;er, I mean
a liking for cult practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are suggesting this woman may have joined
my little flock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; The monk&rsquo;s gaze rested briefly on
Penny as he added: &ldquo;I greatly fear you have been led
astray by loose gossip as to the nature of the order I
am founding here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Mr. Ayling about your work because I think
it&rsquo;s so interesting,&rdquo; Penny said quickly. She slapped
her mittened hands together. &ldquo;My, it&rsquo;s cold today!
May we warm ourselves at your fire before we start
back to town?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>A frown puckered Father Benedict&rsquo;s eyebrows.
Plainly the request displeased him. But with a show
of hospitality, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our abode is very humble and poorly furnished.
Such as it is, you are welcome.&rdquo; Bowing slightly, he
stepped aside to admit the visitors.</p>
<p>Penny and Mr. Ayling found themselves in a long,
barren, and very cold hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, please,&rdquo; bade the monk.</p>
<p>Moving on the bare boards with noiseless tread, he
led them through an arched doorway cut in the
thick wall, across a wind-swept pillared cloister and
into a parlor where a fire burned brightly in a huge,
time-blackened fireplace.</p>
<p>The sheer comfort of the room surprised Penny.
Underfoot was a thick velvet carpet. Other furnishings
included a large mahogany desk, a sofa, two easy
chairs, and a cabinet filled with fine glassware, gold
and silver objects, and a blue glass decanter of wine.</p>
<p>Black velvet curtains were draped in heavy folds
over an exit door, and similar hangings covered the
windows. To Penny&rsquo;s astonishment, the ceiling,
painted black, was studded with silver stars.</p>
<p>However, the object which held her roving gaze
was a large crystal ball supported on the claws of a
bronze dragon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a crystal gazer!&rdquo; Mr. Ayling exclaimed as
he too noted the curious globe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have the power to read the future with reasonable
accuracy,&rdquo; replied the monk. He dismissed the subject
with a shrug, motioning for his guests to seat
themselves before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of searching for a Mrs. Rosenthorne&mdash;&rdquo;
he remarked, addressing the investigator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Ayling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Mrs. Hawthorne. Apparently you
were under the misapprehension that she is in some
way connected with this establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a hope. My client has a deep interest
in cults. I traced Mrs. Hawthorne and her granddaughter
to Riverview, and thought possibly they
might have been attracted to your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little flock is limited to only twelve members
at present. All are very humble people who have
sworn to live a life of poverty, devoted to charity and
faith. We have no Mrs. Hawthorne here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t she have given another name?&rdquo; suggested
Penny. She stretched her cold fingers to the leaping
flames on the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so.&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s lips curled
in a superior smile. &ldquo;Describe the woman, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ayling repeated the description Penny had
heard earlier that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no such person here,&rdquo; the monk said. &ldquo;I
regret I am unable to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>He arose, a plain hint that he considered the brief
interview at an end. Somewhat reluctantly, Penny
and her companion also turned their backs upon the
crackling fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made a comfortable place of this room,&rdquo;
the girl said. Her gaze fastened admiringly upon a
porcelain decanter in a wall cabinet. &ldquo;And such interesting
antiques!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since the visitors had arrived,
Father Benedict&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collecting art treasures is a hobby of mine,&rdquo; he
revealed. Crossing to the cabinet, he removed the
decanter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a piece of Ching-Hoa porcelain and very
rare,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And here is a Byzantine amulet&mdash;priceless.
The golden goblets came from a European
church destroyed a century ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid to keep such treasures in the
monastery?&rdquo; Mr. Ayling inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s dark eyes glittered
with a strange light. &ldquo;I must confess I know not the
meaning of the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so far out, I don&rsquo;t suppose you can expect
much police protection,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winkey, my gateman, is quite dependable. While
he is on duty, no thief or unwanted stranger will enter
our grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Winkey is good at keeping folks out,&rdquo; agreed the
investigator dryly. In walking toward the door, he
paused to gaze again at the crystal ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My glass interests you?&rdquo; inquired the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen those things before, but never took stock
in them,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t actually
conjure up pictures by gazing into that globe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to see for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a little out of my line,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try it!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. The principle is very simple. One
merely gazes deeply into the glass until the optic nerve
of the eye becomes fatigued. As it ceases to transmit
impression from without, one sees events of the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it explained a little differently,&rdquo; said
Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;As the optic nerve becomes paralyzed,
it responds to the reflex action proceeding from the
brain of the crystal gazer. One sees what one wishes
to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not agree!&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice was
sharp. &ldquo;The ball accurately foretells the future.
Shall we test and prove its powers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try it!&rdquo; pleaded Penny again.</p>
<p>Smiling a bit grimly, the monk extinguished an
overhead light and touched a match to the wick of
two tall white candles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Placing the crystal ball in front of a black screen,
he set the burning tapers at either side. Penny suddenly
began to lose zest for the adventure.</p>
<p>But before she could think of a graceful way to
announce that she had changed her mind, the monk
took her firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place your hands on either side of the crystal ball,&rdquo;
he directed. &ldquo;<a href="#front">Gaze deep into the glass. Deep&mdash;deep.</a>
And now my little one, what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>CREAKING WOOD</i></h2>
<p>As Penny peered down into the highly polished
surface of the crystal clear glass, a multitude of dancing
points of light drew and held her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaze deep&mdash;deeper,&rdquo; intoned the monk. &ldquo;Do you
not see a picture forming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The glass has become cloudy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. In a moment it will clear. Now what
do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict tapped the toe of his slipper impatiently.
&ldquo;You are resisting the glass,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;You do not believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny continued to stare fixedly into the crystal
ball. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she said finally, pulling her eyes
away. &ldquo;Guess I haven&rsquo;t enough of the witch in me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped back from the dragon standard on
which the globe stood, and for a minute was stone
blind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing!&rdquo; she gasped in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The optic nerve is paralyzed,&rdquo; said the monk,
steadying her as she swayed slightly. &ldquo;Vision will be
normal in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to distinguish objects now,&rdquo; Penny
admitted, reassured.</p>
<p>The monk released her arm. Seating himself before
the crystal globe, he placed his hands on the polished
surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now shall I try?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;What would
you like to know about the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might find Mrs. Hawthorne for me,&rdquo; the investigator
said in jest.</p>
<p>In the darkened room, Father Benedict&rsquo;s hooded
face looked grotesque as light from the tall tapers
flickered upon his angular jaw bones.</p>
<p>The moment was impressive. A tomb-like silence
had fallen upon the three, and the only sound was the
crackle of the fire.</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, Penny was certain she heard
another noise. Though the occasion should not have
been one for alarm, she felt her skin prickle. A tiny
chill caused her to shiver.</p>
<p>Or was it a chill? Against her cheek she felt a
breath of icy wind. Somewhere beyond the room a
door had opened. Unmistakably, she heard the creak
of old wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s startled gaze roved to Mr. Ayling. Oblivious
to all else, the investigator was watching Father
Benedict closely.</p>
<p>Every sense now alert, the girl listened intently.
Had someone stepped on a loose board as he crept
along the passageway? Or had she merely heard the
old house groaning to itself?</p>
<p>The creaking sound was not repeated.</p>
<p>Trying to throw off the pall which had fallen upon
her, Penny centered her full attention upon the monk.
As one hypnotized by the glass into which he peered,
he mumbled words difficult to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the ball is clearing,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What is
this? I see a resort city on the sea coast&mdash;the rush and
roar of waves. Ah, a beach! On the sand are two
bathers&mdash;one a girl of perhaps sixteen or seventeen
with dark hair. She wears a green bathing suit. Upon
her third finger is a black cameo ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A startled look came upon Mr. Ayling&rsquo;s face, but
he made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her companion is an elderly woman,&rdquo; continued
the monk as if speaking in a trance. &ldquo;Over her shoulders
is flung a dark blue beach cape. The picture is
fading now&mdash;I am losing the vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s attention, wandering again, was drawn as
if by a powerful magnet to the curtains covering the
exit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>In fascination, she watched. An inch at a time, the
door moved outward. Then a hand appeared between
the black velvet draperies, cautiously pulling them
apart.</p>
<p>Penny wondered if her eyes were playing tricks
upon her. She felt an overpowering impulse to laugh
or call out. Yet her throat was dry and tight.</p>
<p>The scene seemed fantastic. It couldn&rsquo;t be real, she
told herself. Yet those curtains steadily were moving
farther apart.</p>
<p>An arm came into view, then the side of a human
figure. Last of all, a face, ghostly pale against the
dark background, slowly emerged.</p>
<p>For one fleeting instant Penny saw a girl only a
little older than herself, standing half wrapped in the
folds of the velvet curtain. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>In that moment, through Penny&rsquo;s brain flashed the
message that the one who crouched in the doorway
was the same girl she and Louise had picked up on
the road only the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be the
same person! I must be dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one behind the curtain had raised a finger to
her lips as if commanding silence. Then the draperies
were pulled together with a jerk and the figure was
gone.</p>
<p>Another cold breath of air swept through the room,
causing candles on either side of the crystal ball to
flicker. Again Penny heard the soft <i>creak</i>, <i>creak</i> of
wood as footsteps retreated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>She tried to speak, but the words stuck in her
throat. Had her imagination played tricks upon her?</p>
<p>Slowly she turned her eyes upon Father Benedict,
whose back had been toward the curtained door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another picture is forming in the crystal ball,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;I see a man walking through a lonely
wood. But what is this? Evil persons lie in wait behind
the tall pine trees. Now they are waylaying
him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fall upon him and beat him with their cudgels.
Woe is me! They leave him lying on the ground.
The man is dying&mdash;dead. Oh, evil, evil! I can read
no more in the glass today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arising quickly, and brushing a hand over his glazed
eyes, Father Benedict leaned for a moment against the
damp plaster wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, please,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;What I saw
was most unnerving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk poured himself a drink of water and
lighted a lamp on the center table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can see again,&rdquo; he said in a more natural
tone. &ldquo;A reading always is an exhausting experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your demonstration was most impressive,&rdquo; said
Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;How would you interpret your vision
of Mrs. Hawthorne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say the woman and her granddaughter at
this very moment are enjoying a pleasant vacation in
a sunny climate. California perhaps, or Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne was in Florida, but she bought a
ticket to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, she never arrived here,&rdquo; replied the
monk. &ldquo;You see, the crystal glass never lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your advice would be to resume my search
in Florida?&rdquo; the investigator asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not presume to advise you.&rdquo; From a cabinet,
Father Benedict removed a black cloth which he used
to polish away an imaginary speck on the crystal
globe. Then he covered the standard with a cloth
hood and added impressively: &ldquo;However, I consider
it my duty to warn you of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warn me?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;Of what
danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My second vision was most disturbing,&rdquo; Father
Benedict said gravely. &ldquo;As I interpret it, great harm&mdash;perhaps
death, will pursue the man who walks alone
in the woods, unless he alters his present course. You
came to Riverview for a definite purpose, Mr.
Ayling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, to find Mrs. Hawthorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling, for your own well being, you must
abandon the search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the monk very low, &ldquo;the vision was
sent to me that you may be saved from disaster. The
man attacked in the woods was yourself, Mr. Ayling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>A WARNING</i></h2>
<p>If Father Benedict&rsquo;s words disturbed the investigator,
he gave no sign. Smiling, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I am not a firm believer in the art of crystal
gazing&mdash;all respect to your remarkable talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk frowned as he carefully laid another log
on the dying fire. &ldquo;You will be unwise to disregard
the warning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most unwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should interpret the picture as such, dear Mr.
Ayling. Apparently, if you pursue your present
course, you are certain to meet misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what &lsquo;present course&rsquo; do you refer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I would not know,&rdquo; replied the monk coldly.
&ldquo;Now may I thank you for coming to our humble
abode and bid you good afternoon? I have a formal
meeting soon with members of my little family of
believers and must nap for a few minutes. You will
excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were just leaving,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really
deeply interested in your society here. May I come
sometime soon to watch a ceremony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk gazed at her sharply but answered in a
polite voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, when we are better organized and have our
house in order, we shall be most happy to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way out of the building, through the chilly
cloister and gloomy hall, Penny looked carefully about
for the girl who so stealthily had opened the door of
the monk&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>She saw no one. Mr. Ayling and Father Benedict,
she was certain, were unaware of the incident which
had so startled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t imagination,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I did see the
door open. But it may not have been that girl Louise
and I met last night. Probably it was a member of
Mr. Highland&rsquo;s cult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply puzzled, Penny decided that if an opportunity
presented itself, she would revisit the monastery
another day.</p>
<p>At the front door of the building, Father Benedict
turned to bid his guests goodbye. Before he could retreat,
a loud commotion was heard near the gatehouse.</p>
<p>The monk listened intently and with evident annoyance.
&ldquo;My! My! What now?&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Are
we to have no peace and quiet within our walls?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Near the front gate, Winkey could be seen arguing
with a stout, middle-aged man in a racoon coat who
carried an easel and a palette under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders are to keep folks out o&rsquo; here!&rdquo; Winkey
shouted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are! Ye ain&rsquo;t settin&rsquo;
foot inside here, unless the boss says so! Now get
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to put me out!&rdquo; the visitor challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I will!&rdquo; retorted the hunchback.</p>
<p>He would have seized the visitor by the arm, had
not Father Benedict called to him from the doorway:
&ldquo;Winkey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father,&rdquo; the hunchback mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me what is wrong,&rdquo; the cult leader bade
as he went down to the gate, followed by Penny and
Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;Who is this gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Vernon Eckenrod,&rdquo; the visitor introduced
himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an artist. I live down the road
a quarter of a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to come in and paint a picture,&rdquo; interposed
Winkey. &ldquo;I told him nothin&rsquo; doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man doesn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Eckenrod,
glaring at the hunchback. &ldquo;I am doing a series of
pictures of the monastery for a national magazine.
The sketches are finished and now I&rsquo;m starting to
paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you wish to do exterior scenes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exterior and also interior. I want to do the arch
to the chapter house today, and if I have time, either
the stone-hooded chimneys or the window of the
guest hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You show remarkable familiarity with the monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming here for more than a year,&rdquo; the
artist said, shifting his easel to a more comfortable
position. &ldquo;This building is one of the oldest in the
state. See, I have a key.&rdquo; He held it before the startled
gaze of the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice became less
friendly. &ldquo;And may I inquire how you came into
possession of a key to my property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I have rented these premises from the
owner, with an option to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to buy the place myself,&rdquo; the artist
said, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t pay the amount asked. I&rsquo;d like to
restore the buildings and make it into a real show
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you obtain a key?&rdquo; the monk reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the owner gave me one. He lets me paint here
whenever I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monastery now is exclusively mine,&rdquo; said
Father Benedict. &ldquo;Kindly turn the key over to me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Eckenrod, giving it up. &ldquo;But
you won&rsquo;t mind if I come here to finish my paintings?
I&rsquo;m under contract to complete the work by the fifteenth
of the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict secreted the key in the folds of his
robe. &ldquo;I appreciate your position,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nevertheless,
we cannot have strangers intruding upon our
privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everyone around here knows me! Ask anyone
about my character and work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not question your character, my good man.
But I must request you not to come here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here!&rdquo; the artist exclaimed, losing his
temper again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get the idea! My pictures
are half done. If I don&rsquo;t complete the order, I&rsquo;ll stand
to lose months of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Complete them from the sketches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;the color and feeling would be
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict turned as if to leave. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo;
he said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Eckenrod began furiously.</p>
<p>The monk coldly walked away, entering the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard him!&rdquo; cried Winkey, triumphantly.
&ldquo;Now git going and don&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; the artist retorted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be
here again. You can&rsquo;t get away with this even if you
have rented the property!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Scarcely aware of Penny and Mr. Ayling, who followed
him to the gate, Mr. Eckenrod stomped off
with easel and palette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t get away with it!&rdquo; he stormed, addressing
no one in particular. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back here
with the sheriff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Father Benedict is within his rights,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken over the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the artist became aware of his presence.
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he admitted grudgingly, &ldquo;legally he
is within his rights, I suppose. But what of justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem only decent of him to allow you to
complete your paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming to the monastery for months, off
and on,&rdquo; the artist revealed in an aggrieved tone. &ldquo;Always
figured I&rsquo;d buy the place. The owner, Peter
Holden, picked it up at a foreclosure sale for a mere
nothing. He&rsquo;d have sold to me too, if this fellow
hadn&rsquo;t come along. Who is he, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His gateman looks like a thug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your unfortunate encounter with Winkey
prejudiced you,&rdquo; smiled the investigator. &ldquo;After
all, the man apparently was acting under orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like that monk either!&rdquo; the artist scowled.
&ldquo;He acted as religious as my Aunt Sara!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;His real name is Jay Highland,&rdquo; Penny contributed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crystal gazer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! A fine calling! If the authorities are
smart, they&rsquo;ll look into his business here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio now had reached the roadside where
Penny&rsquo;s car was parked. Politely, she offered to give
the artist a lift to his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I&rsquo;ll walk,&rdquo; he declined the offer. &ldquo;I
live only a short distance. I&rsquo;ll just cut through the
fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dark eyes still snapping like firebrands, the
artist strode off through the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a character!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ayling, once
he and Penny were in the car. &ldquo;An eccentric!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Mr. Eckenrod really is a fine artist,&rdquo;
Penny replied. &ldquo;Too bad Father Benedict wouldn&rsquo;t
let him complete his paintings. By the way, what did
you think of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m any judge of character, he&rsquo;ll soon be
back to make more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean Father Benedict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed pleasant enough,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling said
slowly. &ldquo;However, I can&rsquo;t say I went for the crystal
ball demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anyone could tell that was the bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, it gave me quite a jolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the monk&rsquo;s warning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;His description
of Mrs. Hawthorne and her daughter. Of course, I&rsquo;ve
never seen either of them, but the picture he conjured
up seemed to fit them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he probably made it up.&rdquo; Penny started the
car which rolled with creaking tires over the hilly,
snow-packed road toward the city. &ldquo;You described
Mrs. Hawthorne to him earlier, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did. Except for one small detail, the reading
would not have impressed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that detail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In describing the girl on the beach, Father Benedict
said she was wearing a black cameo ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did! You certainly never mentioned that
to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rather jarred me,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;Because,
when Rhoda Hawthorne last was seen, she was
wearing just such a cameo ring!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>

<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>INTO THE CREVASSE</i></h2>
<p>Enroute to Riverview, Penny and Mr. Ayling
discussed all phases of their strange interview with
Father Benedict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man may be all right,&rdquo; the investigator said.
&ldquo;Nevertheless, as a matter of routine I&rsquo;ll check on him.
Where was he before he came to Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are the members of his mysterious cult?
Riverview people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I know. The only persons I&rsquo;ve seen
on the premises are Winkey, the one they call Julia,
and a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl? Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She peeped from behind a door
while Father Benedict was giving the crystal ball
reading. I started to speak and she motioned me to
keep quiet. Then she slipped away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was. For just a minute I thought she might
be a girl I picked up on the road the other night in my
car. The room was shadowy though, so I got no clear
impression of her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet the girl&mdash;also the other members
of the cult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I! Why not visit there again soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try it tomorrow, say about this same
time,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan to remain
in Riverview longer than another twenty-four hours
unless I obtain a clue to Mrs. Hawthorne&rsquo;s whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Winkey won&rsquo;t let us in,&rdquo; commented
Penny dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll worry about that when the time comes.
Perhaps if he makes trouble, we can find ways to persuade
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I pick you up at your hotel?&rdquo; Penny offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the investigator agreed. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
I&rsquo;ll wire my office for photographs of Mrs. Hawthorne
and her granddaughter which can be published in your
father&rsquo;s paper. Also, I&rsquo;ll ask our company to check on
Father Benedict&rsquo;s past. He may be operating a quick
money racket here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do distrust him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but I&rsquo;ve learned from past experience
it pays to overlook nothing. Father Benedict is an
eccentric. He may be all right and probably is. All
the same, it will be interesting to learn more about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>A little later, after agreeing to meet the next afternoon
at two o&rsquo;clock, Penny dropped Mr. Ayling at
his hotel. In a high state of excitement, she then drove
on home to report the day&rsquo;s adventure to Mrs. Weems
and her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling&rsquo;s awfully nice and smart too!&rdquo; she
declared at the dinner table. &ldquo;Together we&rsquo;ll find
Mrs. Hawthorne and solve the mystery of the monastery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mystery?&rdquo; teased her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Penny admitted with a chuckle.
&ldquo;But give me time! I&rsquo;ll find one! I can feel it bubbling
in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems, who came into the dining room with
a platter of roast beef, observed: &ldquo;If you take my advice,
you&rsquo;ll stay away from that place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only invite trouble by going there,&rdquo; the housekeeper
said severely. &ldquo;Furthermore, it will distract
you from your school work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;School teachers&rsquo; convention this week!&rdquo; Penny reminded
her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off tomorrow and next day too!
Don&rsquo;t worry about anything happening to me at the
monastery, Mrs. Weems. Mr. Ayling makes a dandy
chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going with him, I suppose I can&rsquo;t
protest,&rdquo; the housekeeper gave in. &ldquo;Mind, you&rsquo;re home
before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;No rash promises
though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon, sharp at two o&rsquo;clock, she drove
to the front entranceway of the Riverview Hotel.
Mr. Ayling was nowhere to be seen. After waiting
ten minutes, she parked and went inside to inquire at
the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling has room 416,&rdquo; the clerk told her.
&ldquo;Doubt whether you&rsquo;ll find him in just now. He left
here late last night and hasn&rsquo;t been back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; thought Penny. Aloud she asked
if the investigator had left any message for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say where he was going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he evidently intends to be back. His
luggage is still here, and he hasn&rsquo;t paid his bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To satisfy herself, Penny telephoned Room 416.
No one answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he could have thought he was to meet
me at the monastery?&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Guess I may as
well drive out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sunshine was strong and the day slightly warm.
Penny, who had worn heavy skiing clothes, shed her
coat before she reached the monastery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Pulling up at the barrier gate, she glanced hopefully
about. Mr. Ayling was nowhere to be seen. If he
had arrived ahead of her, undoubtedly he was inside
the building.</p>
<p>As Penny hesitated, wondering what to do, Winkey&rsquo;s
ugly face appeared behind the iron spokes of
the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You again!&rdquo; he observed with a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m looking for a friend of mine, Mr. Ayling,
who was here yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we got him hid somewheres?&rdquo; the
gateman asked insolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might have come here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t. And Father Benedict ain&rsquo;t here
either. So you can&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though annoyed by the hunchback&rsquo;s curt manners,
Penny held her temper in check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much wanted to talk to your master,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I may ask him to allow me to join the cult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, and, as was
his habit, he then blinked rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t here just to snoop around?&rdquo; he asked
with distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an idea!&rdquo; Penny hoped that her laughter
sounded convincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye want to join the cult, you can talk to Father
Benedict later,&rdquo; the hunchback said grudgingly. &ldquo;But
unless you got something to contribute, it&rsquo;s no use
trying to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Either cash on the line or jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what becomes of the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes for charity.&rdquo; Winkey fast was losing
patience. &ldquo;Now cut out the questions!&rdquo; he said
crossly. &ldquo;If you want to join the society, talk to the
boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any other girls staying here?&rdquo; Penny
had been leading up to this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to the boss, I said!&rdquo; Winkey snapped.
&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll be here tomorrow. Now go away and
stop botherin&rsquo; me. I got work to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed by her failure to find Mr. Ayling or
extract information from Winkey, Penny returned
to the car.</p>
<p>Driving along the road a few minutes later, she
glimpsed, far over the hills, a skier who descended the
steep slope at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful day for skiing!&rdquo; she thought,
recalling that all of her equipment was ready in the
car. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I make the most of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling up, Penny got out skis and poles. Hastily
waxing the runners, she put them on and set off
across the fields toward the distant hill.</p>
<p>The loose snow had blown into deep banks and crevasses.
Penny frequently had been warned by more
experienced skiers that visible crevasses nearly always
were a warning of hidden ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>At first as she raced along, she kept alert watch for
unexpected breaks or depressions in the snow. But
as she drew near the hills to the rear of the old monastery,
she frequently shifted her gaze toward the
interesting old building.</p>
<p>Smoke curled lazily from the hooded chimneys.
Otherwise, the premises appeared unoccupied.</p>
<p>Then, Penny saw a bent figure coming from the
rear of the grounds, pulling a long sled behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Winkey!&rdquo; she recognized him. &ldquo;Now
what can he be doing with that sled? Surely at his
age he isn&rsquo;t going coasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than a little interested, the girl set her course
the better to watch the hunchback. Soon she saw
him striking off toward a pine woods and a large,
two-story log cabin some distance away.</p>
<p>At the edge of the woods, not far from the cabin,
had been stacked several cords of seasoned logs taken
from the forest.</p>
<p>Pulling his sled alongside, Winkey began to pile
it high with the cut firewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s his wood?&rdquo; thought Penny.</p>
<p>So absorbed had she become in Winkey&rsquo;s actions
that she neglected to watch the drifts ahead. Too
late, she saw that her singing skis were taking her
directly into a wide, deep crevasse.</p>
<p>Desperately, Penny swerved and tried to check her
speed. The break in the snow was extensive and
could not be avoided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Over the brink she shot. Poles flew from her hand
and she clutched wildly for a hold on the bank.
Failing, she tumbled over and over, landing in an
ungainly heap of splintered skis at the base of the
deep pit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>A CALL FOR HELP</i></h2>
<p>After coming to a stop at the bottom of the
crevasse, Penny momentarily was too stunned to
move.</p>
<p>Gradually recovering her breath, she gingerly
twisted first one leg, then the other. Though pains
shot through them, no bones were broken.</p>
<p>Rolling over on her back, the girl gazed up at the
narrow opening far above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served me right for being so careless!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;But the $64 question, is how am I going
to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With fingers numb from cold, Penny removed her
broken skis.</p>
<p>Walls of the hole into which she had fallen were
sharp and firm with frozen ice, offering few if any
handholds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Unwilling to call attention to her plight unless
absolutely necessary, she studied the sheer walls carefully,
and then, grasping a projection, tried to raise
herself to a ledge just over her head. The ice broke
in her fingers, and she tumbled backwards again.</p>
<p>Penny now began to suffer from cold. Her clothes,
damp from perspiration, were freezing to her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to be proud!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to shout for help and hope Winkey hears me.
He&rsquo;s the last person in the world I&rsquo;d ask voluntarily,
but if he doesn&rsquo;t help me, I may be trapped here hours!
I could freeze to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shouted for help and was alarmed by the
sound of her own voice. Not only was it weak, but
it seemed smothered by the walls of the crevasse.
She knew the cry would not carry far.</p>
<p>But as she drew a deep breath preparatory to shouting
again, she heard voices only a short distance away.</p>
<p>Her first thought was that her cry for help had
been heard and someone was coming to her aid.</p>
<p>The next instant she knew better. Those who
approached were arguing violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stole the wood from my land!&rdquo; she heard
the accuser shout. &ldquo;I saw you pile it on your sled,
and you&rsquo;re carrying it away now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny recognized the gruff voice of Vernon Eckenrod
and guessed that he was talking to Winkey.
Evidently the two were coming closer, for their argument
was waxing louder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Forgetting her own predicament, Penny listened
intently. The pair were now almost at the brink of
the crevasse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say something!&rdquo; Eckenrod roared. &ldquo;What excuse
have you got for stealing my wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Button your lip!&rdquo; Winkey retorted. &ldquo;The boss
told me to get some wood for the fires at the monastery.
So I done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told you to steal, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll git your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t the point! I cut that wood myself
from my own land, and I want it for my own use!
Here, give me that sled! You&rsquo;re hauling it straight
back where you got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny heard the sound of scuffling, and then above
her, at the mouth of the crevasse, she saw the two men
struggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Startled by her voice, Eckenrod turned and looked
down. At that instant, when he was off guard, the
hunchback struck him. Reeling backwards, the artist
tried to recover balance and could not. With a shriek
of fright and rage, he fell into the chasm.</p>
<p>Penny attempted to break the man&rsquo;s fall with her
body. She was not quick enough, and he rolled to the
very bottom, ending up on a pile of broken skis.
There he lay groaning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>If Penny had expected that Winkey would be
aghast at his brutal act, she was to learn otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; he shouted in glee. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
never accuse me of stealing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us out!&rdquo; Penny called.</p>
<p>She knew Winkey heard her, for he stopped short
and peered down into the crevasse to see who had
appealed for help. Giving no sign he had seen her,
he then disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s going for a rope!&rdquo; Penny thought.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d quicker think he&rsquo;s deserting us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now thoroughly alarmed, the girl crept over the
slippery ice to Vernon Eckenrod&rsquo;s side. He was conscious
but stunned. Blood gushed from a cut on the
back of his head and one leg remained crumpled beneath
him.</p>
<p>With a handkerchief, Penny attempted to stop the
flow of blood. She was relieved to note that the
wound was a superficial one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to sit up,&rdquo; the girl urged. &ldquo;If you lie on the
ice your clothes will soon freeze fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eckenrod&rsquo;s eyes opened and he stared blankly at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How did you get
down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell, the same as you. I&rsquo;m Penny Parker, the girl
you met yesterday at the monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her help, the artist pulled himself up on an
elbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you now,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Did you
see that hunchback push me down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. It was a brutal thing to do. I think
now he may have gone for a rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it!&rdquo; Eckenrod said bitterly.
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t help us if we were freezing to death!
The man is a thief! He was stealing my wood! I&rsquo;ll
have the law on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we have to get out of here,&rdquo; Penny reminded
him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eckenrod became sober as he studied the sharp
walls of the crevasse. The only possible handhold
was a ledge well above their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can boost me up, I think I can make it,&rdquo;
Penny said. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eckenrod attempted to get to his feet, but his left
leg crumbled beneath him. Pain and despair were in
his eyes as he gazed at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now we are in a fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trying not to disclose fright, Penny said the only
thing to do was to call for help. However, after she
had shouted until she was nearly hoarse, she too was
filled with despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winkey isn&rsquo;t coming back,&rdquo; she acknowledged.
&ldquo;And no one else is close enough to hear our cries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an attempt to ease Mr. Eckenrod&rsquo;s pain, Penny
tore strips of cloth from her underskirt, and used the
broken skis to make a splint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my right leg,&rdquo; the
artist insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good and strong. If only I
could get up on it, I think I could boost you to the
ledge. We&rsquo;ve got to do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you really do it?&rdquo; Penny asked, hope reviving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; the artist replied grimly. &ldquo;Night&rsquo;s
coming on. We&rsquo;ll freeze if we&rsquo;re here an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Penny&rsquo;s help, Mr. Eckenrod after several attempts,
managed to struggle upright on his good right
leg. He weaved unsteadily a moment, then ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now onto my shoulders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scrambled up, grasping the icy ledge above.
It broke in her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Eckenrod, gritting his
teeth.</p>
<p>With desperate haste, Penny obtained another
handhold which seemed fairly firm. She could feel
Mr. Eckenrod sagging beneath her. Knowing it was
then or never, she heaved herself up and rolled onto
the ledge. Miraculously, it held her weight.</p>
<p>Relieved of the burden of the girl&rsquo;s weight, Mr.
Eckenrod collapsed on the floor of the crevasse again,
moaning with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Eckenrod!&rdquo; Penny was aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he urged in a stern voice. &ldquo;You can
make it now! Climb on out and bring help! And
be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>MR. ECKENROD&rsquo;S SECRET</i></h2>
<p>Thus urged, Penny scrambled up the slippery,
sloping side of the wall and reached the top safely.</p>
<p>Completely spent, she lay there a moment resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo; she called to Mr. Eckenrod.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back as fast as I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closest house was the artist&rsquo;s own cabin in the
woods. Plunging through the big drifts, the girl
pounded on the door.</p>
<p>Almost at once it was opened by a middle-aged
woman with graying hair and alert, blue eyes. Seeing
the girl&rsquo;s rumpled hair and snow-caked skiing
suit, she immediately understood that something was
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mrs. Eckenrod?&rdquo; Penny gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband has had a bad fall and his leg may
be broken! We&rsquo;ll need a rope and a sled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Mrs. Eckenrod won Penny&rsquo;s admiration by the cool
manner with which she accepted the bad news. After
the first quick intake of breath, she listened attentively
as Penny told her what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find a long rope in the shed,&rdquo; she directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one we have is a very small one my
grandchildren use when they come here to play. It
will have to do. You&rsquo;ll find it in the shed too. While
you&rsquo;re getting the things, I&rsquo;ll telephone a doctor to
come right out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need a man to help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one lives within miles except those folks who
moved into the monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get no help from there!&rdquo; Penny said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Riverview for men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t dare wait, Mrs. Eckenrod. Your husband
is half frozen now. We&rsquo;ll have to get him out
ourselves somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we must, we can,&rdquo; replied the woman quietly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone the doctor and be with you in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her way to the shed, Penny looked hopefully
across the darkening hills for a glimpse of the lone
skier she had seen earlier in the afternoon. He was
nowhere visible.</p>
<p>By the time Penny had found a rope and the sled,
Mrs. Eckenrod joined her. The woman had put on
a heavy coat, galoshes, and carried woolen blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did the accident happen?&rdquo; she asked, as they
plodded through the drifts together.</p>
<p>Penny related the unfortunate argument involving
the theft of firewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! It&rsquo;s Vernon&rsquo;s dreadful temper again!&rdquo;
Mrs. Eckenrod exclaimed. &ldquo;He is a wonderful man,
but ready to quarrel if anyone crosses him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, I think he was in the right,&rdquo; Penny
replied, helping her companion over a big drift. &ldquo;I
saw the hunchback take the wood, and I heard the
argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When those new people moved into the monastery,
I was afraid we would have trouble with them.
Something queer seems to be going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Penny asked, recalling that
she had expressed the identical thought at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the house is so quiet and deserted by day.
Come night, one hears all sorts of weird noises and
sees roving lights. Last night I distinctly heard a
woman scream twice. It was most unnerving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed anyone except the hunchback
and his master leaving the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a young girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I didn&rsquo;t imagine it!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eckenrod stared at her, puzzled by the remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Penny did not take time to explain, for they now
had reached the crevasse. Anxiously, the rescuers
peered down into the darkening hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon!&rdquo; his wife cried.</p>
<p>At sound of her voice, he stirred and sat up.</p>
<p>Relieved that he was still conscious, Penny
stretched out prone at the lip of the crevasse.
Rapidly, she lowered the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knot it around your waist!&rdquo; she instructed.</p>
<p>Mr. Eckenrod obeyed and with a supreme effort,
got up on his good leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now up you come!&rdquo; Penny shouted encouragingly.
&ldquo;If you can help just a little, I think we can
make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Eckenrod was a solidly built, strong woman.
Even so, it was all the two could do to pull the artist
up onto the overhanging ledge. Completely spent, he
lay there for a while as his rescuers recaptured their
breath. Then, the remaining distance was made with
less difficulty.</p>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Eckenrod rolled the man onto the
sled, covering him with warm blankets. Even then,
their troubles were not over. To pull the sled
through the drifts to the cabin, took the last of their
strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did it!&rdquo; Penny cried jubilantly as they made
a saddle of their arms to carry the artist into the warm
living room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Mrs. Eckenrod threw a log on the fire and went to
brew hot coffee. Penny sponged the blood from the
artist&rsquo;s head but did not attempt to bandage it, knowing
a doctor was on the way.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Dr. Wallace arrived from
Riverview. After carefully examining the artist&rsquo;s
leg, he placed it in a splint and bandaged it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be on crutches for a few days,&rdquo; he told Mr.
Eckenrod. &ldquo;The bone may be cracked, but there is
no break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard today!&rdquo; Mr.
Eckenrod declared in relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some important
business to take up with a certain party!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon!&rdquo; remonstrated his wife.</p>
<p>After the doctor had gone, Mr. Eckenrod was put
to bed on the davenport. But he refused to remain
still. As the pain in his leg eased, he experimented
walking with the aid of a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be using my pins in three days at the latest!&rdquo;
he predicted. &ldquo;Just as soon as I can get around, I&rsquo;m
going to the monastery and punch that hunchback&rsquo;s
nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Vernon&rsquo; me,&rdquo; the artist glared at his
wife. &ldquo;The man richly deserves it! He&rsquo;s a thief
and bully!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Penny gathered up her mittens which had been
drying by the hearth. &ldquo;You may have trouble getting
into the monastery,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;If Winkey sees
you first, he&rsquo;ll probably lock the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that would stop me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else could you get in? Over the fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a way,&rdquo; the artist hinted mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret entrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Eckenrod&rsquo;s quick grin told Penny that her
guess had been right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did me a good turn today, so I&rsquo;ll let you into
the secret,&rdquo; the artist said. &ldquo;Help me hobble into the
studio, and I&rsquo;ll show you something that will make
your eyes pop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>MAP OF THE MONASTERY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here, lend me a shoulder!&rdquo; Mr. Eckenrod
ordered as Penny hesitated. &ldquo;Or aren&rsquo;t you interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am&mdash;but your leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! The doc said it wasn&rsquo;t
broken, didn&rsquo;t he? I&rsquo;ll be walking as well as ever in
a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supported on one side by Penny and on the other
by his wife, the artist hobbled to the adjoining studio.</p>
<p>On easels about the room were many half completed
paintings. Several fine pictures, one of the artist&rsquo;s
wife, hung on the walls. A paint-smeared smock had
been draped carelessly over a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon,&rdquo; sighed his wife, reaching to retrieve the
garment, &ldquo;you are so untidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without you, my dear, I should live like a pig in a
sty and revel in it,&rdquo; chuckled the artist.</p>
<p>At a desk, amid a litter of letters and papers, were
several large sheets of yellowed drawings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These are the original plans of the monastery,&rdquo;
Mr. Eckenrod said, placing them in Penny&rsquo;s hands.
&ldquo;They show every detail of the old building before
it was remodeled by later owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get these plans, Mr. Eckenrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present owner of the building let me have
them to study at the time I planned to buy the property.
He would have sold the place to me too if
that soft-talking fellow who calls himself Father
Benedict hadn&rsquo;t come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon, you mustn&rsquo;t speak that way of him!&rdquo;
reprimanded his wife in a shocked tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
he&rsquo;s a good, kind man of religion. Just because you
had a quarrel with his servant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Benedict has less religion than I&rsquo;ve got in
my little finger!&rdquo; the artist growled. &ldquo;You said yourself
only last night that something&rsquo;s wrong at the
place! What of those screams we heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was explained to me that a simple-minded
woman named Julia works at the monastery,&rdquo; Penny
volunteered. &ldquo;She is supposed to be easily upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Eckenrod. &ldquo;All I can say
is, Father Benedict surrounds himself with mighty
queer people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really none of our affair, Vernon,&rdquo; said his
wife mildly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What goes on there is my business until the paintings
are finished! But Father Benedict and ten hunchbacks
can&rsquo;t keep me away! With these plans I can
always outwit them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they show?&rdquo; Penny could not make
much from the dim lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building is built on the pattern of Sherborne
in England,&rdquo; Mr. Eckenrod explained. He pointed
out the main part of the church with nave, south and
north transepts, choir and chapel. &ldquo;This section is
a ruin now, but could be restored. Unfortunately,
the roof has caved in and all paintings and statues
were long ago destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me the cloister,&rdquo; requested Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo; The artist pointed with a stubby
thumb. &ldquo;Passages radiate from it. One leads to the
old chapter house. North of the cloister is the refectory,
used as a dining room. Behind is the abbey&rsquo;s
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sleeping rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re above the refectory and also to the west
of the cloister. Under the refectory are the cellars.
They also extend beneath the old chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever visited them, Mr. Eckenrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cellars? I have. Also the burial crypt. A
few of the old tombs remain in fairly good state of
preservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the secret passageway?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the crypt. It leads into the churchyard
to the west of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do many people know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think I&rsquo;m the only one. The building
owner never bothered to study the plans, because he
wasn&rsquo;t interested. Father Benedict may have learned
the secret, but if so, he stumbled onto it by accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the passageway well hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very cleverly. From the churchyard, one enters
an empty tomb above ground. A passageway leads
down to the crypt beneath the old chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very pleasant way to enter or leave a building,&rdquo;
said Penny with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But convenient in a pinch,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Eckenrod.
&ldquo;If Father Benedict is stubborn about allowing
me inside, I&rsquo;ll bide my time and slip in to finish
my paintings one of these days when he is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poring intently over the plans, Penny remarked
that she would like to explore the passageway sometime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a few days until my leg is strong and I&rsquo;ll
take you through!&rdquo; the artist offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Father Benedict should catch us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can handle him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vernon, you shouldn&rsquo;t put Miss Parker up to such
tricks!&rdquo; his wife protested. &ldquo;When it comes to playing
pranks, or getting even with folks, you&rsquo;re just
like a child!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was no child&rsquo;s play pushing me into the
crevasse!&rdquo; the artist exclaimed. &ldquo;As soon as I can
hobble to town, I&rsquo;ll swear out a warrant for that
hunchback&rsquo;s arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And involve us in an endless feud with our neighbors,&rdquo;
his wife sighed. &ldquo;Vernon, you must forget
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion was brought to an abrupt end by
Penny who declared that she must leave immediately.
The Eckenrods thanked her again for her timely
assistance, urging her to visit them again soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget our date!&rdquo; the artist added with a
chuckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be walking in a day or two. Then
we&rsquo;ll explore the crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget,&rdquo; promised Penny.</p>
<p>Shadows were deepening into early darkness as she
set off across the fields, guided by a flashlight Mrs.
Eckenrod insisted she take.</p>
<p>The motor of her car was cold, the oil heavy.
After two attempts she started it and soon was entering
the outskirts of Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if Dad&rsquo;s still at the office?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;If he is, I may as well give him a lift home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Penny had parked and climbed the
stairs to the <i>Star</i> editorial room, the hands of her
wristwatch were nosing six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The first edition had rolled from the presses, and
reporters, their feet on the desks, were relaxing for
a few minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Mr. DeWitt, the city editor, sat scanning the paper,
noting corrections or changes to be made in the next
edition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mr. DeWitt!&rdquo; Penny greeted him as she
paused by the desk. &ldquo;Dad here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Penny,&rdquo; the editor smiled at her.
&ldquo;He was a minute ago. Yes, here he comes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt jerked his head sideways toward the
publisher&rsquo;s private office. Mr. Parker had on his hat
and topcoat and would have left by the rear exit
without having seen Penny had she not overtaken
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a lift home, Dad?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Penny!&rdquo; he said, pausing in surprise.
&ldquo;I certainly do. I left my car at home today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside them, an unhooded Western Union teletype
bell began to ring insistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Penny inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An incoming telegram,&rdquo; her father explained.
&ldquo;We have a direct wire with the Western Union
office now. It saves sending so many messenger boys
back and forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage of the machine began to move and
the telegram was typed on the long roll of yellow
copy paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s for you, Dad!&rdquo; Penny said in surprise.
&ldquo;A wire from Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago?&rdquo; Mr. Parker repeated. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better
wait and see whom it&rsquo;s from. By the way, how
did you and Mr. Ayling make out this afternoon at
the monastery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him since yesterday, Dad. When I
went to the hotel to meet him, he wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busy with other matters perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;but he might have
notified me. He missed a lot of excitement by not going
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could tell her father about the skiing accident,
the teletype message was completed. Mr.
Parker ripped it from the machine. He whistled
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this wire is from Mr. Ayling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s in Chicago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently so. Listen to his message: &lsquo;CALLED
HERE UNEXPECTEDLY BY TELEGRAM
SIGNED MRS. HAWTHORNE. TELEGRAM
PROVED A FAKE. RETURNING TO RIVERVIEW
IMMEDIATELY TO RESUME SEARCH.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>THE LOCKED DOOR</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you know!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed as
she peered over her father&rsquo;s shoulder to reread the
telegram. &ldquo;So that explains why Mr. Ayling didn&rsquo;t
meet me today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he takes the first train back, he should get in
early tomorrow,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;I wonder who
tricked him into going to Chicago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever did it probably figured he&rsquo;d give up the
search for Mrs. Hawthorne in disgust,&rdquo; Penny added
excitedly. &ldquo;Dad, this case is getting more interesting
every minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled but made no comment as he
pocketed the telegram. Together he and Penny went
downstairs to the waiting car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I could help Mr. Ayling by inquiring
around the city if anyone has seen Mrs. Hawthorne or
her granddaughter,&rdquo; Penny suggested as she drove
with skill through dense downtown traffic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Mr. Ayling checked all hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the larger ones, I imagine. Anyhow, I might
run into interesting information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, if you like,&rdquo; her father encouraged her.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Penny set off alone to visit
a dozen hotels. At none of them had anyone by the
name of Hawthorne registered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have used an assumed name,&rdquo; Penny
thought, a trifle discouraged. &ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll never
find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopeful that Mr. Ayling might arrive on the morning
train, she went to the Union Railroad Station.
Among those waiting on the platform for the incoming
Chicago Express was Winkey, the hunchback.</p>
<p>He did not see Penny, and in the large crowd, she
soon lost sight of him.</p>
<p>Finally, the train pulled in. But Mr. Ayling did
not alight from either the coaches or pullmans. Feeling
even more depressed, Penny went home for lunch.</p>
<p>Several times during the afternoon, she telephoned
Mr. Ayling&rsquo;s hotel to inquire if he had arrived. Each
time she was told he had not checked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s keeping him in Chicago?&rdquo; Penny
mused. &ldquo;I hope he didn&rsquo;t change his mind about coming
back here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Throughout the day, she kept thinking about the
monastery and its strange occupants. The skiing incident
of the previous afternoon had convinced her
that Winkey at least was cruel and dishonest. As to
Father Benedict&rsquo;s character, she could not make up
her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly he doesn&rsquo;t know how surly and mean his
servant acts,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Someone ought to tell
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny longed to return to the monastery, but hesitated
to go there for the deliberate purpose of reporting
Winkey&rsquo;s misbehavior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling may return here tomorrow,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Then perhaps we can drive out there together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, a check of the Riverview Hotel the following
morning, disclosed that the investigator still
had not arrived in the city.</p>
<p>Decidedly mystified by his failure to return, Penny
clomped into the Parker kitchen after having spent an
hour downtown. To her surprise she saw that during
her absence a bulky package had been delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came for you a half hour ago,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me! Must be a mistake. I&rsquo;ve ordered nothing
from any store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly the package bore her name, so she tore off
the heavy wrappings. Inside was a pair of new hickory
skis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad must have sent them!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just
what I need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>However, the skis were not from her father.
Among the wrappings she found a card with Mr.
Eckenrod&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try these for size,&rdquo; the artist had scrawled in an
almost illegible hand. &ldquo;Thanks for pulling me out of
a hole! My leg is mending rapidly, so don&rsquo;t forget
our date!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the darling!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Mighty decent
of him to replace the skis I broke! Only I&rsquo;m afraid I
won&rsquo;t get to use them many times. It&rsquo;s thawing fast
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping her slim ankles through the leather bindings,
she glided awkwardly about the polished linoleum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon&rsquo;s luncheon?&rdquo; she asked impatiently. &ldquo;I
want to go skiing right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it on after I&rsquo;ve telephoned Jake Cotton,&rdquo;
the housekeeper promised. &ldquo;He failed to show up
here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Cotton, the carpenter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your father ordered another bookcase for the
den. Jake promised to build it last week. He&rsquo;s always
putting other jobs ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After telephoning, Mrs. Weems toasted sandwiches
and made hot chocolate. Penny ate rapidly, as was
her habit when thinking of other matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need any help with the dishes,&rdquo; she said
hopefully when the meal was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, run along and ski,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems smiled. &ldquo;In
spirit you&rsquo;re already out there on the hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny changed quickly into skiing outfit and telephoned
Louise Sidell, inviting her to go along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; her chum agreed half-heartedly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
still lame from the last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the girls reached the hills near the Abbington
Monastery, the weather had turned discouragingly
warm.</p>
<p>Touring over the slopes, they discarded first their
mittens, then their jackets. After Louise had fallen
down several times, soaking her clothes in melted
snow, she proposed that they abandon the sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So early in the afternoon?&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;Oh,
we can&rsquo;t go home yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s try something else. It&rsquo;s no fun skiing
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze fastened speculatively upon the distant
chimneys of the old monastery visible through the
pine trees. &ldquo;I have it, Lou!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going there!&rdquo; cried Louise, reading the
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Already Penny was removing her
skis. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t learned half what I want to know
about that place and the people who live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me the shivers to go near the property.
Anyhow, that old hunchback never will let us inside!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we try, just for luck? Come on, Lou,
at least we can talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much against her will, Louise was induced to accompany
Penny to the big grilled gate.</p>
<p>To their surprise, it stood slightly ajar as if in invitation
for them to enter. The front grounds were deserted
and so was the gatehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck!&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Winkey&rsquo;s
gone off somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s feet were reluctant as she followed her chum
to the entrance door of the monastery. &ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo;
she whispered, but already Penny had thumped the
lion&rsquo;s head knocker against the brass plate.</p>
<p>Several moments elapsed and then a peephole panel
just above their heads shot open. Old Julia, in white
lace cap, her eyes dilated with wonder or fear, peered
out at them.</p>
<p>Her lips moved in a gibberish they could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s telling us to go away!&rdquo; Louise decided
quickly. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Wait!&rdquo; Penny held tight to her chum&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Someone else is coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she spoke, the door opened and Father
Benedict towered above them in his impressive robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he inquired. The word was mildly spoken
but with no cordiality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Father,&rdquo; said Penny brightly. &ldquo;I
hope you don&rsquo;t mind our coming here again. We&rsquo;re
deeply interested in the work you&rsquo;re doing and would
like to learn more about the cult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story for newspaper publication?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Penny assured him, reading displeasure
in his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just interested on general principles.
No one sent us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk relaxed slightly but still did not invite
the girls in. &ldquo;I am very busy today,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps
another time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we&rsquo;ll be in school after this weekend,
Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are preparing for a ceremonial to be held in
the cloister,&rdquo; Father Benedict frowned. &ldquo;I deeply
regret&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a ceremonial!&rdquo; Penny interrupted eagerly.
&ldquo;May we see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not allowed. Only members of our cult
may take part or observe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least you don&rsquo;t mind if we come in and
warm ourselves at your hospitable fire,&rdquo; Penny said,
determined not to be turned away. &ldquo;Since the organization
is devoted to charity, shouldn&rsquo;t it begin with
a couple of school girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict&rsquo;s thin lips cracked into a slight
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My observation would lead me to believe that the
day is a warm one and that neither of you are suffering
from frost-bite. However, I admire perseverance and
it shall be rewarded. You may come in&mdash;though only
for a short while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Father!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed, rather
astonished by the decision.</p>
<p>In her eagerness to enter, she nearly stumbled over
Old Julia, who huddled by the wall just inside the
door. Angrily, the monk glared at his servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep from underfoot, Julia!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Begone
to the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman, with a frightened glance directed
at Louise and Penny, scurried away.</p>
<p>Once inside, the girls could understand why visitors
were not welcome, for little had been done to make
the place habitable since Penny&rsquo;s previous visit.</p>
<p>Through chilly halls the monk conducted the girls
to the study beyond the cloister. There he motioned
them to footstools before the fire. On the hearth a
large log which Penny suspected had come from the
Eckenrod property, had burned down to a cherry
mass of coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, suppose you tell me what you actually came
here to learn?&rdquo; Father Benedict asked, looking hard at
Penny.</p>
<p>The abrupt question caught her slightly off guard.
She could think of no ready reply. As she debated
whether or not to tell him of Winkey&rsquo;s fight with
Mr. Eckenrod, footsteps pounded down the corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Suddenly the study door was flung open. The
hunchback stood there, breathing hard from having
hurried so fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick!&rdquo; he said tersely to the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Winkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparing to follow the hunchback, Father Benedict
briefly made his excuses to the girls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be gone only
a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Warm yourselves until my return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the door had closed behind the pair, Penny
said in a low tone: &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s up? So far as I
know, the only rooms below are the storage cellars
and crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some of the dead bodies are coming to life!&rdquo;
Louise joked feebly. &ldquo;I hate this place worse every
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She arose and wandered slowly about the room.
&ldquo;Somehow, the air is oppressive. I feel as if doom
were about to descend upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nerves!&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<p>Louise paused beside the crystal ball. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this
thing?&rdquo; she asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Father Benedict&rsquo;s crystal globe. Take a
look and see what&rsquo;s doing in the cellar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I am,&rdquo; Penny agreed. Arising, she joined
Louise and for a long moment peered intently into the
depths of the crystal ball. Seeing nothing in the glass
she muttered in disgust: &ldquo;Bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does one reach the basement and crypt?&rdquo;
Louise inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to a plan I saw at Mr. Eckenrod&rsquo;s, a
stairway leads down from the far end of the cloister.
Say! Why not do a little exploring while Father
Benedict is away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never have a better chance.&rdquo; Crossing the
room in long strides, Penny tried to open the door.</p>
<p>The knob turned readily, but the door would not
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou,&rdquo; she exclaimed in dismay, &ldquo;Father Benedict
certainly played a nice trick on us! We&rsquo;re locked in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>OLD JULIA&rsquo;S WARNING</i></h2>
<p>Badly frightened, Louise came quickly to
her chum&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the door is locked?&rdquo; she asked nervously.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s only stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked all right. We&rsquo;ll do no exploring today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s scream for help! We&rsquo;ve got to get out of
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Benedict is in the basement and wouldn&rsquo;t
hear us,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he may have locked us in on purpose too!
But I heard no key turn in the lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door may have an automatic catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Penny agreed to keep her
chum from worrying. &ldquo;Father Benedict should be
back soon. Let&rsquo;s not let him know we even noticed
the door was locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he fastened it on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have,&rdquo; Penny said slowly. &ldquo;Perhaps he
didn&rsquo;t want us to wander about the monastery while
he was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, my pet. Now do stop worrying! The
smart thing for us to do, is to learn what we can while
we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot we can learn locked up in this stuffy room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, Penny wandered about the room,
scrutinizing art objects and each piece of furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a man who professes to live a life of poverty,
Father Benedict shows quite a liking for luxury items,&rdquo;
she remarked.</p>
<p>Coming to a battered desk cluttered with papers, she
paused and eyed it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we wouldn&rsquo;t dare pry!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise,
guessing what was in her chum&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; sighed Penny, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m sure Mr.
Ayling would do it if he were here. Those papers in
the pigeon holes look as though they&rsquo;re unpaid bills&mdash;a
whole stack of them too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the desk lay an open account book and the girl
gazed at it with keen interest. A long list of names
had been written in ink. On one side of the ledger
was a column marked &ldquo;Contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you are snooping!&rdquo; accused Louise, but
she added with an excited laugh: &ldquo;If you find anything
worth while, let me know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then consider yourself officially notified!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Startled, Louise went quickly to the desk. &ldquo;What
have you found?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Penny showed her the book in which were listed
many names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like a report covering donations made
by cult members to the society!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Do
you suppose Mrs. Hawthorne&rsquo;s name is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly the girls examined the tiny ledger. First
on the list was a Mrs. Carl Kingsley, who had contributed
two diamond clips at estimated value of $650.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear of her?&rdquo; Penny asked, for the name was
unfamiliar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. She may not be from Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly they scanned the entire list. There were
many names, all of women. Contributions included
cash, pearls, silver bracelets, gold wrist watches, an
emerald pin, and other articles of jewelry.</p>
<p>However, the girls could not find Mrs. Hawthorne&rsquo;s
name, nor that of her granddaughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This list doesn&rsquo;t prove anything one way or the
other,&rdquo; Penny said, carefully replacing the ledger on
the desk where she had found it. &ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne
could have joined the cult under a different name.
Father Benedict might not even know who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny!&rdquo; teased her companion. &ldquo;You want
to uncover a mystery so badly! Actually, there&rsquo;s not
one bit of evidence that Mrs. Hawthorne ever came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged in a low tone, &ldquo;but
you will admit a lot of queer things have happened.
For instance, who sent Mr. Ayling the fake telegram?
And why hasn&rsquo;t he returned to Riverview as he said
he would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hardly had time yet. Anyway, what connection
could his absence have with this monastery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, perhaps. Unless Mrs. Hawthorne should
be here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny! Father Benedict denied that she was,
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that crystal ball reading he gave for Mr.
Ayling&rsquo;s benefit was a strange affair. And Lou! The
worst was, <i>he predicted harm would befall him</i>!
Maybe it has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re superstitious! Do you really believe in
those crystal ball readings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Penny denied hotly. &ldquo;Not for a
minute do I put any faith in that crystal ball! But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling is delayed in Chicago, so you start to
worry,&rdquo; completed Louise. &ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re certainly
building up a case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; Penny admitted with a shrug.
&ldquo;However, other things bother me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scream we heard at midnight. Mr. Eckenrod
and his wife told me they had been awakened by
strange noises here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you understand from Father Benedict that
Old Julia causes the commotion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s plain to see she is a poor demented
creature. Still, there&rsquo;s something about her&mdash;when
we came in today, I had a feeling that she was trying
to tell us something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did warn us away. However, in her condition
she might say anything. So I dismissed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could talk to Old Julia when Father Benedict
isn&rsquo;t around,&rdquo; Penny said soberly. &ldquo;I have a
hunch she could tell us interesting things about this
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do distrust Father Benedict!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Penny denied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been pleasant
enough to us, and I suppose he has a perfect right to
start a crazy cult here if he chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only crazy but profitable,&rdquo; Louise reminded
her. &ldquo;Those contributions listed total up to several
thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Father Benedict, the money goes to
charity. But what charity? It&rsquo;s a cinch he isn&rsquo;t
spending much in supporting the members of his cult.
This building is as barren as a barn, and I&rsquo;ve not seen
any supplies come into the place while we&rsquo;ve been
around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are the cult members?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must stay in their rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there are people in this household who
aren&rsquo;t listed in the ledger,&rdquo; Penny resumed thoughtfully.
&ldquo;For instance, that girl I saw when I came here
with Mr. Ayling. Who is she, and where does she
keep herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not ask Father Benedict&mdash;that is, if we ever
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to do it, Lou. If ever I
started asking questions, I wouldn&rsquo;t know where to
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one that bothers me,&rdquo; Louise said,
roving toward the door. &ldquo;How are we going to get
out of here? Let&rsquo;s call for help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Penny agreed reluctantly. &ldquo;I hate to do
it though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First testing the door again to be certain it was
locked and not stuck, she pounded with her fists on
the heavy oak paneling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us out!&rdquo; Louise called loudly. &ldquo;Let us out!
We&rsquo;re locked in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to fetch someone!&rdquo; chuckled Penny.
&ldquo;Listen! I think I hear footsteps now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From down the corridor, the girls detected a soft
patter and a creaking of boards. To attract attention
to their plight, they again pounded on the oaken panel.</p>
<p>The footsteps approached the door and halted.
Penny, her ear pressed to the panel, could hear the
sound of breathing on the other side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us out!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked in here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; came the loud hiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Old Julia!&rdquo; Penny whispered to Louise.
&ldquo;Do you suppose she&rsquo;ll have sense enough to help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Louise muttered, resigning herself to a
long wait in the monk&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;Maybe we can get
across to her the idea that she should bring Father
Benedict here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Julia,&rdquo; Penny began, speaking slowly and
as clearly as she could. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked in here and
we need help. Can you bring your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; came the sharp answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then unlock the door,&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Key gone,&rdquo; the old woman mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you find it? Don&rsquo;t you know where your
master keeps them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, but the girls heard the old
woman scurry away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she gone to find a key, or has she just gone?&rdquo;
Louise sighed. &ldquo;Father Benedict probably still is in
the basement with Winkey, so we can expect no help
from that quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impatiently, Penny glanced at her wrist watch. Actually,
they had been locked in the room less than
twenty minutes, but it seemed three times that long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless!&rdquo; Louise said, seating herself by the
fire again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped here until Father Benedict
gets around to letting us out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>At the door, Penny&rsquo;s keen ears detected sound.
Again the pad, pad of footsteps!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Julia&rsquo;s coming back!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Maybe
she&rsquo;s not as stupid as we thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously the girls waited. To their great relief,
they heard a key turn in the lock. Then, an inch at a
time, the door was pushed open.</p>
<p>Old Julia, her eyes wild, and hair streaming down
her face, stared blankly in at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Julia!&rdquo; said Penny. She tried to touch the
woman&rsquo;s hand in a gesture of friendship, only to have
her shrink back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Penny attempted to
sooth her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; the woman mumbled, her cracked lips quivering.
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Seeing us here always seems to upset her, Penny
thought.</i> Aloud she remarked: &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re leaving
now. If Father Benedict wonders what became of us,
I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll just have to guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls started toward the cloister with Old Julia
following a step behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry! Hurry!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;No time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have plenty of time, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean,&rdquo; replied Penny, smiling at her in a friendly way.
Suddenly she halted as the thought occurred to her
that she might obtain useful information from the
woman if only she phrased her questions skillfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Julia, you must know everyone who lives here in
the dormitory rooms,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Do you often see
a girl about my age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange light flickered for a moment in the old
woman&rsquo;s watery gray eyes, then died. She merely
stared at Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No soap!&rdquo; commented Louise. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, however, was persistent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia, you must have seen her&mdash;a girl like me,&rdquo; she
emphasized. &ldquo;Does she sleep here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash;&rdquo; the word seemingly had aroused
an unpleasant chain of thought in the old woman&rsquo;s
twisted mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the girl&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; Penny probed.</p>
<p>Julia did not act as if she had heard the question.
She was mumbling to herself, a look of horror upon
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she saying?&rdquo; Louise demanded, unable to
catch a word.</p>
<p>Penny bent closer. Distinctly she heard the old
woman mutter: &ldquo;The canopied bed! In the chapel
room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then old Julia stiffened and she flattened herself
against the wall of the passageway, her eyes wide with
fear.</p>
<p>Directly ahead, in the doorway opening onto the
cloister, stood Father Benedict.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>AN ASSIGNMENT FOR PENNY</i></h2>
<p>Father Benedict&rsquo;s face was as expressionless
as a marble statue, but his dark eyes smoldered with
anger.</p>
<p>Ignoring Penny and Louise for the moment, he
fixed the cringing Julia with stern gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not order you to remain in the kitchen?&rdquo; he
demanded. His voice was low, almost purring. Nevertheless,
the woman acted as if she had been lashed
with a whip.</p>
<p>Mumbling unintelligibly, she scurried off down the
covered passageway along the side of the cloister, and
disappeared through another doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, it wasn&rsquo;t Julia&rsquo;s fault that she was here,&rdquo;
said Penny, feeling sorry for the unfortunate woman.
&ldquo;Louise and I called for help and she came to assist us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were locked in the study,&rdquo; added Louise.
&ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t come to our rescue, we would have been
there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand you to say you were <i>locked</i> in?&rdquo;
asked the monk, his shaggy eyebrows lifting in astonishment.
&ldquo;The door sticks sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was locked,&rdquo; interposed Penny quietly. &ldquo;We
tried several times to open it. Julia finally let us out
with a key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having divulged this bit of information, she immediately
regretted it. A shadow passed over the monk&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A key?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;How would Julia know&mdash;&rdquo;
Breaking off, he smiled and completed: &ldquo;The locks
here are very old and sadly in need of repair. I
must have a locksmith in immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict fixed his gaze upon one of the
twisted, weather-stained columns of the cloister, for
the moment seeming to forget the girls. Becoming a
little uncomfortable, they edged toward the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be going now,&rdquo; said Penny to remind him of
their presence. &ldquo;That is, unless you&rsquo;ll permit us to
witness the cult ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main hall has not yet been prepared,&rdquo; Father
Benedict replied quickly. &ldquo;We have postponed the
ceremony until later tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we could return then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be highly inadvisable.&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s
deep frown plainly showed that he was becoming irritated.
&ldquo;The members of our sect are sensitive to
visitors. I regret onlookers are not as yet welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s telling me in a nice way to mind my own
business</i>, thought Penny. Aloud she said: &ldquo;I see.
Well, later on, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Politely, Father Benedict escorted the girls through
the cloister. Penny noted that much of the dirt and
debris had been swept away. A beautifully carved
stone stairway, which she had failed to notice upon
her previous visit, led up to a narrow balcony.</p>
<p>Observing that many doors opened from it, she inquired
if the dormitories were above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; the monk replied in a brief tone which
discouraged further questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so still in here,&rdquo; remarked Louise as they
walked on. &ldquo;One never would dream many people
are staying in the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lead a quiet life,&rdquo; the monk explained. &ldquo;For
the most part, my people spend their time reading or
in meditation and prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three now had reached the front door, and
Penny thought she detected an expression of relief
upon Father Benedict&rsquo;s face as he opened it for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;was anything seriously
wrong in the cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Nothing at all! Merely a leaking pipe.
A plumber will take care of it. Thank you, and good
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no show of haste, but very firmly, the monk
closed the door in their faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like that!&rdquo; Penny muttered. &ldquo;I
never received a smoother brush-off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snow was melting fast and running in rivers down
the brick walk as the girls sauntered toward the gate.
Winkey was nowhere to be seen, but knowing he
might be close by, they were careful not to discuss
Father Benedict until they were well beyond the
property boundaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess this puts an end to your visits here,&rdquo;
remarked Louise as they walked toward the parked
car. &ldquo;Father Benedict seems determined not to let
you witness one of the cult ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which makes me all the more determined to see
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch he&rsquo;ll turn you away if you call at
the monastery again. Why don&rsquo;t you forget the place,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! I have an idea&mdash;it just came
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll sneak back at night or something
equally as dramatic,&rdquo; teased Louise.</p>
<p>Penny plucked an icicle from a roadside bush, nibbling
at it thoughtfully as she replied: &ldquo;Only as a last
resort. No, I&rsquo;ll drop in at the newspaper office and
get Mr. DeWitt, the city editor, to assign me to do a
feature story on the ceremony tonight. If I officially
represent the <i>Riverview Star</i>, Father Benedict can&rsquo;t
so easily turn me away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The girls had reached the car. Stowing their skiing
equipment, they motored rapidly toward the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of Old Julia?&rdquo; Penny inquired
as they neared Louise&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;Especially her
remark about the canopied bed in the chapel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever heard of a bed of any kind in a chapel?&rdquo;
Louise scoffed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dizzy, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a map Mr. Eckenrod showed me, I know the
chapel is just off the cloister above the crypt,&rdquo; Penny
recalled, switching on the windshield wiper to clear
the glass of melting snow. &ldquo;I suppose it could have
been converted into a bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think her remark meant a thing. She mumbles
most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but the thing I noticed was that she seemed
so afraid of Father Benedict. Do you suppose he
abuses her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny! A man of his calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a real monk. Apparently this cult is only
an order that has been in existence a short time. Father
Benedict doesn&rsquo;t impress me as a very religious man.
Furthermore, all that crystal-glass-gazing business
leads me to think he&rsquo;s more of a charlatan than anything
else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he runs the place to get money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering, that&rsquo;s all. We know he accepts
very liberal contributions from his converts. Where
does the money go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I were certain he locked us in that room today,
I&rsquo;d believe the worst!&rdquo; Louise declared as the car
stopped in front of the Sidell home. Opening the
door to alight, she added: &ldquo;He put up a good story
though. I guess it must have been an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow,&rdquo; Louise bade her
goodbye. &ldquo;If you arrange to see one of the cult ceremonies,
be sure to let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon now was late. Penny drove to the
<i>Riverview Star</i> building. Girls who worked in the
downstairs business office were leaving for the day,
but upstairs the editorial staff was just swinging into
action for a busy night.</p>
<p>At the city editor&rsquo;s desk a short wave radio blared
routine police calls. Editor DeWitt, an eyeshade
pulled low over his eyes, scowled as he rapidly scanned
copy.</p>
<p>Seeing Penny, he looked up and smiled, which was
the signal for her to explain the purpose of her call.</p>
<p>Going straight to the point, she asked to be assigned
a feature story on the cult ceremony that night in the
monastery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you can get it?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of our reporters already have failed. The
high monkey-monk out there won&rsquo;t allow any of our
men in the building.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d like a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;re interested in what&rsquo;s going on out
there.&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt slashed a page of corrected copy
in half with his long scissors. He dropped one section
onto the floor and the other into the copy basket.
&ldquo;Learn anything worth while out there today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing worthy of print. If you&rsquo;ll assign me to
the story I&rsquo;ll go back tonight. I think I can get inside
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, give me a ring if you run into anything interesting.
Your father know you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t told him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure you do,&rdquo; said Mr. DeWitt, looking her
straight in the eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to find myself
sitting behind the eight ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll let Dad know,&rdquo; Penny assured him hastily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, her father was in conference, so after
waiting around the office a little while, she decided to
talk the matter over with him when he came home
for dinner.</p>
<p>In the elevator, leaving the office, Penny ran into
Jerry Livingston. Hearing of the assignment, he
looked a little worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you ought to go out to the monastery alone
at night?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not met Father Benedict myself,&rdquo; Jerry said,
&ldquo;but one of our reporters who was out there yesterday,
didn&rsquo;t like his appearance. I&rsquo;ll bet a cent your
father refuses to let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Penny said anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put up a
big argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time you leaving?&rdquo; Jerry asked as the elevator
let them out on the main floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early. Maybe around seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all
right, or DeWitt wouldn&rsquo;t have given you the assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parting company with the reporter, Penny stopped
briefly at the Riverview Hotel to inquire if Mr. Ayling
had returned from Chicago. He had not checked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer he doesn&rsquo;t come after sending that telegram,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s delaying him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving home a few minutes later, Penny heard the
sound of pounding as she entered the kitchen. Mrs.
Weems was scraping carrots at the sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good time skiing?&rdquo; the housekeeper
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair.&rdquo; Penny stripped off her mittens and hung
them on a radiator. &ldquo;Snow&rsquo;s melting fast today.
What&rsquo;s that awful pounding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Cotton finally came. He&rsquo;s building the bookcases
in your father&rsquo;s study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; recalled Penny. &ldquo;I thought from the
sound the place was being torn down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>After removing her heavy ski suit and putting her
skiing equipment away, the girl wandered into the
study.</p>
<p>Jake Cotton, a short, wiry old man, was gathering
up his tools preparatory to leaving. Boards of various
length were strewn over the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, reckon I&rsquo;ll call it a day,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
take me all tomorrow to finish the job. That is, if I
can arrange to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have another job?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing a little work for them folks that
moved into the monastery,&rdquo; the carpenter explained.
&ldquo;The man that owns the place pays well, but he&rsquo;s
mighty fussy. Wants the work done the minute he
says!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose a great deal should be done out there, the
building is so old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wreck!&rdquo; Jake Cotton said, picking up his tool
kit. &ldquo;A dozen workmen couldn&rsquo;t put it in liveable
shape in two weeks! They want such trivial things
done too, while they let more important repairs wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the first job the monks had me do was fix the
old freight lift into the cellar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the building had one,&rdquo; said Penny
in surprise. &ldquo;Is it on the first floor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the old chapel room off the cloister,&rdquo; Jake explained.
&ldquo;Least, that&rsquo;s what I took it to be. They&rsquo;re
using it for a bedroom now. I ask you, what would
any sensible person want with a freight lift in a bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem unusual. Why was it originally installed
in the chapel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it was done when the building was built,&rdquo;
Mr. Cotton told her. &ldquo;Years ago, they had burial
services in the chapel, and caskets were lowered to the
crypt below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the lift operate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a section of flooring that lowers when the
machinery is turned on,&rdquo; the carpenter explained.
&ldquo;With a carpet over the boards, you wouldn&rsquo;t know
it was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what purpose is it to be used now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cotton had started for the doorway. Penny
trailed him to the front porch, eager to learn more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the new owners aim to
do with the lift,&rdquo; the carpenter replied, pausing on the
steps. &ldquo;Reckon they&rsquo;ll use it to lower heavy luggage
and maybe unwanted furniture into the basement for
storage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the crypt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get down there. The monk had his own
man, a hunchback, oil up the machinery and put it in
working order. I only repaired the flooring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the room is used as a bedroom now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looked that way to me. Leastwise, I saw a big
bed in there. One of them old fashioned contraptions
with a lot of dust-catching draperies over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a canopied bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon it was,&rdquo; Mr. Cotton answered carelessly.
&ldquo;Well, see you tomorrow if I&rsquo;m not called back to the
monastery to do another rush job! So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the startled Penny could ask another question,
he hurried off down the darkening street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW</i></h2>
<p>Jake Cotton&rsquo;s careless remark about the canopied
bed at the monastery filled Penny with deep excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Old Julia isn&rsquo;t as crazy as she seems!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;The place does have a canopied bed, and
she may have been trying to tell me something about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, Penny was determined to revisit
the monastery that night. Many unanswered
questions plagued her. Not only was she curious to
witness a cult ceremony, but also she wished to learn
the identity of the strange girl who lived on the
premises. And she hoped to view the chapel room
with the freight lift and if possible, to see the canopied
bed of which Old Julia had prattled so unintelligibly.</p>
<p>Hastening into the house, Penny sought Mrs.
Weems in the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do to help with dinner?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, in the act of putting a kettle of
potatoes on the fire to boil, eyed her with instant
suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you plan to go when dinner is over,
may I ask?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only out to the monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again! You came from there not a half hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. DeWitt assigned me to cover a cult meeting
tonight,&rdquo; Penny assured her hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father approves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him yet. He ought to be coming
home any minute now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father telephoned he will be detained,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems explained. &ldquo;I doubt he&rsquo;ll be home before nine
o&rsquo;clock. So the monastery expedition is out of the
question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; Penny was aghast. &ldquo;I promised
Mr. DeWitt! He&rsquo;s depending on the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; the housekeeper replied,
though she softened a little. &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t allow
you to go to the monastery alone at night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll start right away&mdash;just as soon as I can grab
a bite of dinner,&rdquo; Penny broke in eagerly. &ldquo;If Father
Benedict refuses me permission to see the ceremony,
then I can come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, but will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, at least,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs.
Weems, have a heart! Can&rsquo;t I telephone Dad somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper shook her head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in an important
meeting and can&rsquo;t be disturbed until it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will let me go? I won&rsquo;t be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to give in,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
sighed. &ldquo;I usually do. I&rsquo;ll hurry dinner along so you
can get back early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the housekeeper fried pork chops, Penny set
the table and prepared a salad. When the meal was
ready she ate with a haste that shocked Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, your table manners become worse every
day!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Your mind isn&rsquo;t on what you
are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on what I&rsquo;m about to do!&rdquo; Penny chuckled, getting
up from the table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dessert
tonight. See you later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Donning a heavy coat and slipping a flashlight into
one of the deep pockets, she left the house.</p>
<p>The night was dark, for as yet there was no moon.
Penny drove rapidly through Riverview and along
the lonely road which led to the monastery.</p>
<p>Despite the speed of her car, she soon noted that another
automobile was overtaking her. The girl pressed
her foot a little more firmly on the gasoline pedal, but
still the other car gained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>She was driving forty-five miles an hour when the
big black car passed her traveling at least sixty. On
the narrow road, Penny was crowded dangerously
close to the ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve of some people!&rdquo; she muttered in disgust.
&ldquo;No wonder there are so many highway accidents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny caught only a fleeting glimpse of the black
car&rsquo;s driver, a man hunched low over the steering
wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that looked like Winkey!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;And another man was with him in the front seat! I
wonder if it was Father Benedict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny speeded up but found it impossible to keep
the car in view. When she skidded at a curve, she
wisely slowed down and abandoned the chase.</p>
<p>Approaching the monastery ten minutes later, the
girl decided to park a short distance from the entrance
gate. She left the car at the roadside beyond view of
the gatehouse, and tramped on through the slush and
snow.</p>
<p>Coming within sight of the ancient building, she
paused.</p>
<p>The big gate stood ajar, and on the driveway stood
the black automobile which had passed her car down
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was Winkey!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>At the gateway Penny gazed carefully about the
grounds. The hunchback was nowhere to be seen
and the gatehouse remained deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, so good!&rdquo; she encouraged herself. &ldquo;Now
if only Father Benedict doesn&rsquo;t refuse to let me into
the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking over what she would say to the monk,
Penny walked slowly up the driveway. Nearly all of
the snow had melted, leaving large puddles to be
avoided.</p>
<p>However, near where the black car had been parked,
a section of yard was shadowed from the sun during
the day. Here the damp snow remained in deep banks.</p>
<p>As Penny passed the car, she noticed a double set
of men&rsquo;s footprints leading from the parked automobile
toward the rear of the premises.</p>
<p>Also, she observed long marks which indicated the
two men had dragged a heavy object over the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was a sack of potatoes or supplies for
the monastery,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;It must be a job keeping
this place in operation. Riverview stores never would
make deliveries so far out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Windows of the monastery were dark, though far
inside the building dim lights could be seen. With a
feeling akin to dread Penny went to the door and
rapped with the brass knocker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Now that she actually was embarked upon adventure,
she rather regretted she had promised Mr. DeWitt
a feature story. By night the monastery seemed
more austere and unfriendly.</p>
<p>Minutes elapsed and no one came to answer the
door. Impatiently, Penny clanged the knocker several
times in rapid succession. Only then did she hear
approaching footsteps.</p>
<p>At last the big door swung outward to reveal Father
Benedict. His eyes narrowed with displeasure as he
saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired. Penny observed that he was
a little breathless from having hastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you expected to see me here again
so soon!&rdquo; she began with forced gaiety. &ldquo;Do you
mind if I witness the cult ceremony tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We discussed that this afternoon. I am very
sorry&mdash;&rdquo; Father Benedict began to close the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to write a little story about it for the newspaper,&rdquo;
Penny went on, talking fast. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed in her face. Distinctly she heard a
key grate in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like that?&rdquo; Penny muttered
angrily. &ldquo;Who does he think he is, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started away, only to pause and gaze thoughtfully
back at the darkened windows. To return to
the newspaper office without a story would be humiliating.
A good reporter never failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some way to see that ceremony!&rdquo;
she reasoned. &ldquo;Perhaps I can slip in through a rear
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny circled the building, taking care to avoid
snow patches where revealing footprints would be left
behind. She crossed through the old church-yard
with its toppled, weather-stained stones, passing close
along the church wall.</p>
<p>Coming to a small arching door, she tried the knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; she muttered in disgust. &ldquo;One would
think this place were a jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half way around the building Penny found another
door which evidently opened into the kitchen. It too
was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of luck!&rdquo; she decided, losing heart.</p>
<p>As she turned away intending to return to her car,
she noticed a window at shoulder level, opening from
a kitchen wall. A ventilator screen had been inserted
to permit free circulation of outside air.</p>
<p>Penny carefully studied the window. A crack between
the screen and window frame encouraged her
to hope that the mesh might be removed.</p>
<p>Obviously, the plan had disadvantages. In removing
the screen, she might make too much noise and be
detected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a wide patch of snow separated her
from the window. She could not reach the wall without
leaving a trail of telltale footprints.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Then an idea flashed into Penny&rsquo;s mind. How easy
it would be to make deceptive prints in the snow
merely by walking <i>backwards</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Father Benedict discovers my shoetracks, he&rsquo;ll
think someone from inside the building crawled out
the window!&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;At least I hope he
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now completely dedicated to the adventure, the girl
carefully backed toward the window. She took each
step slowly to make a distinct print.</p>
<p>Reaching the window, she tried the ventilator
screen. To her delight, it folded like an accordian
when she pushed one side against the edge of the window.
Making no sound, she removed it.</p>
<p>Listening a moment to make certain no one was
close by, Penny raised the window higher. Then on
strong arms she swung herself up and over the ledge.</p>
<p>The girl found herself in a large kitchen lighted
only by a smoldering log in a great cavern of a fireplace.</p>
<p>Rows of copper pans hung on the smoke-stained
walls. In a huge black kettle, watery soup simmered
over the fire.</p>
<p>Penny turned to close the window and stepped
squarely on the tail of a drowsing cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-eow!&rdquo; screeched the frightened animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Penny huddled against the wall, listening. Her
heart sank as she heard heavy footsteps in the passageway.
The howling cat had brought someone to investigate!</p>
<p>Frantically, the girl glanced about the room. Huge
cupboards which rose from the floor to the ceiling
offered the only possible hiding place in the otherwise
barren kitchen.</p>
<p>Pulling open one of the doors, she saw an interior
cluttered with greasy pans and dishes. With desperate
haste, she tried the adjoining door. This cupboard
was empty except for a few dusty newspapers.</p>
<p>Penny stepped inside, softly closing the door. Only
then, as she heard someone enter the kitchen, did she
realize that in her haste to hide, she had forgotten to
close the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>THE KITCHEN CUPBOARD</i></h2>
<p>Into the kitchen lumbered Old Julia. She picked
up the whimpering cat and began to croon endearments.</p>
<p>Penny breathed easier. The next instant she became
tense again as she heard another person enter the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that noise, Julia?&rdquo; a man demanded
harshly.</p>
<p>Penny recognized Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the cat, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the room so cold? Oh, I see! Against my
orders you opened the window again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Old Julia defended herself. &ldquo;I
hain&rsquo;t been near a door or window since you told me
not to talk to nobody nor let &rsquo;em in. I don&rsquo;t talk to
nobody&mdash;only Patsy, the cat. Nice Patsy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a stupid old woman! What made the cat
howl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. She must&rsquo;ve seen a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cats don&rsquo;t howl unless they are hurt! You opened
the window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the old woman cried.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike me! I&rsquo;m telling you the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny heard the monk walk to the window. Her
heart skipped a beat when he said: &ldquo;Perhaps you are,
Julia! I can see footprints in the snow! Someone
crawled out through this window! You helped that
girl get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; whimpered Julia. &ldquo;I dunno
how the window got open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk seemed to be talking to himself as he
went on: &ldquo;I knew that girl would make trouble the
minute I set eyes on her! If it hadn&rsquo;t been for her
interference, everything would have gone just as
planned! Now she&rsquo;ll have to pay for her folly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Penny thought Father Benedict was
speaking of her. Then it came to her that he must be
referring to the dark-haired girl she had seen briefly
on the day of her first visit to the monastery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the only time she&rsquo;s slipped out of here!&rdquo;
the monk went on angrily. &ldquo;But it will be the last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict rang a bell. While waiting for it to
be answered, he slammed down the kitchen window.</p>
<p>Soon Winkey, the hunchback, appeared. &ldquo;You
called me, boss?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the monk. &ldquo;And kindly remember not
to call me &lsquo;boss.&rsquo; Father Benedict is a more respectful
term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a laugh,&rdquo; rejoined Winkey rudely. &ldquo;What
did you call me for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out the window and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footprints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going away from the monastery,&rdquo; Father Benedict
added. &ldquo;That girl has run off again! This time
when she gets back, see that she is punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command seemed to startle the gateman for he
asked dubiously: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; The monk&rsquo;s words dropped like chips of
steel. &ldquo;The usual punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t it a little harsh for a girl? She&rsquo;s only a
kid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a kid!&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice rose in mockery.
&ldquo;From the hour we came here she has been a
thorn in my side. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for her interference,
we would have been away from here yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, if those are your orders. Are you sure the
girl has skipped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I am. I found the window open, and
there are the footprints in the snow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she won&rsquo;t be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will,&rdquo; Father Benedict said grimly. &ldquo;You see,
so long as we have her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to listen intently. From the direction
of the cloister a silver bell had chimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The signal for the processional!&rdquo; Father Benedict
exclaimed, interrupting himself. &ldquo;I must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the doorway he apparently paused, for Penny
heard him say to Julia:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start dishing up the soup ready to serve as soon
as the ceremony is over! A bowl and four crackers to
each person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all they&rsquo;re getting to eat?&rdquo; Winkey inquired.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a lot of squawks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that the members of our sect have
taken a vow of poverty and abstinence,&rdquo; retorted the
monk with heavy sarcasm. &ldquo;If there are any complaints,
I know how to handle them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure do,&rdquo; agreed Winkey, his laughter crackling.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hand you the gold plated medal for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices of the two men died away, informing Penny
that they had gone. As she huddled in the cramped
quarters, she could hear Julia moving about the
kitchen. The woman sighed heavily and once muttered:
&ldquo;Woe is me! Wisht I was dead, I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minutes elapsed and the girl became increasingly
uncomfortable and impatient. Old Julia showed no
inclination to leave the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get out of here or I&rsquo;ll miss the entire
ceremony!&rdquo; Penny told herself. &ldquo;Well, here goes!
If Julia screams, I&rsquo;m a cooked goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening the cupboard door a tiny crack, she peered
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Old Julia had lighted candles. In their flickering
light she could be seen with her back to Penny, stirring
the soup. On the table beside her were ten
wooden bowls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now or never!&rdquo; the girl thought. &ldquo;Julia may
give me away, but I&rsquo;ll have to chance it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening the door wider, she moved noiselessly out
and glided across the floor. A board creaked. But as
Julia turned her head, Penny reached out and covered
her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>Seeing her, the old woman&rsquo;s eyes dilated with fear,
but she could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to scream! Don&rsquo;t say a word!&rdquo; Penny
warned. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you! I&rsquo;m here to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman tried to break from the girl&rsquo;s grasp.
Penny kept talking to her in a soothing tone until
gradually she relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you keep quiet if I release you?&rdquo; she finally
demanded.</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s head bobbed up and down.</p>
<p>Penny removed her hand, expecting the worst. But
Julia did not scream. Instead, she stared fixedly at
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia, I must see the ceremony, and Father Benedict
isn&rsquo;t to know I am here,&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;Will you keep my secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Julia&rsquo;s head inclined, but the look of terror
remained in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she whispered, pointing to the window.
&ldquo;Leave while there is time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I&rsquo;ve seen the ceremony. Julia, I need a
robe. Where can I find one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So stupidly did Julia stare at her that Penny was
certain the woman did not understand. However,
after a moment she shuffled to one of the storage cupboards
where linen was kept. Returning with a white
cotton robe, she placed it in the girl&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Penny put the garment on over her coat, pulling the
hood well down over her blond curls.</p>
<p>Then, with another whispered warning to Julia not
to reveal her presence, she left the kitchen. The disguise
gave her renewed confidence, for in the shadowy
halls she felt that only at close range would anyone
recognize her.</p>
<p>Three stone steps led up to the cloister. Approaching
with great caution, Penny observed that it too had
been lighted with candles.</p>
<p>In the center of the cloister near the old fountain,
Father Benedict&rsquo;s crystal globe had been set up. On
either side stood stately rows of tall candles.</p>
<p>Impressive as was the sight, Penny had no time to
admire it, for a door had opened. Winkey came in,
dragging a girl by the wrist.</p>
<p>With a shock Penny recognized her as the same
girl she had seen while visiting the monastery with
Mr. Ayling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s the same one Louise and I picked up in
our car!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>The girl struggled to free herself from the hunchback&rsquo;s
firm grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she cried, kicking at him. &ldquo;Let me
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he taunted her. &ldquo;This time
you&rsquo;ll have to pay for sneaking out of the house and
coming back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo; the girl
retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been out of this house tonight!
If I could get away, I&rsquo;d bring the police and have you
arrested! You can&rsquo;t mistreat me! Let go my wrist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Winkey could answer, another door opened
to admit Father Benedict. Walking straight toward
the hunchback he exclaimed harshly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool! Don&rsquo;t bring her in here! The ceremony is
starting! Lock her up and be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>THE CULT CEREMONY</i></h2>
<p>As Penny watched from behind a pillar in the
cloister, Winkey pulled the struggling girl through a
doorway and out of sight.</p>
<p>Father Benedict then adjusted his long robe and
rang a silver bell. With stately tread he retired to a
position behind the crystal globe.</p>
<p>An instant later from the far side of the cloister, a
door was flung open. A procession of ten persons in
white robes moved slowly into the shadowy room.</p>
<p>As far as Penny could tell, all who participated were
women, many of advanced age. Leaders of the strange
procession carried banners embroidered in silver and
gold symbols.</p>
<p>The white robed figures moved slowly along the
passageway, and Penny saw that they would pass the
pillar where she stood.</p>
<p>Fearing detection, she shifted position slightly to
avoid being seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>But as the mumbling, chanting group passed her, she
was overcome with a sudden impulse to join the procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get up close, I&rsquo;ll be able to hear what is
said!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll learn the secret of
Father Benedict&rsquo;s strange power over these people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the procession passed the pillar, Penny attached
herself to the rear. With bowed head, she followed
the others who formed a semicircle about the fountain.</p>
<p>The monk began a chant in Latin which Penny
could not understand. However, his gestures were
eloquent, and despite herself, she was impressed.</p>
<p>Presently he spoke in English, quoting the White
Lady of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t">&ldquo;Mortal warp and mortal woof</p>
<p class="t">Cannot brook this charmed roof;</p>
<p class="t">All that mortal art hath wrought</p>
<p class="t">In our cell returns to naught.</p>
<p class="t">The molten gold returns to clay,</p>
<p class="t">The polish&rsquo;d diamond melts away;</p>
<p class="t">All is alter&rsquo;d, all is flown,</p>
<p class="t">Naught stands fast but truth alone.</p>
<p class="t">Not for that thy quest give o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t">Courage! prove thy chance once more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Eloquently, the monk then praised the frugal life,
assuring his listeners that those who gave of their
treasure to the cult society would receive untold spiritual
values.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you file past the fountain cast your jewels into
the basin,&rdquo; he bade the group. &ldquo;You will be rewarded
three-fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the robed women circled the fountain. The
one leading the procession dropped a bracelet. The
woman following fumbled beneath her robe and reluctantly
gave a cameo broach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the last gift of my dear departed husband,&rdquo;
she whispered tearfully. &ldquo;I do so dislike to part with
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have your reward,&rdquo; the monk assured
her. &ldquo;Later, in the crystal globe, you will see the face
of your husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how he rules them!&rdquo; thought Penny.
&ldquo;He plays upon their emotions and then pretends to
conjure up visions of departed relatives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another woman stripped a diamond ring from her
finger, and cast it into the bowl of the fountain. The
one who followed her, stood empty handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your contribution?&rdquo; demanded the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none, O Master! At the last ceremony, I
gave all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who have no gift for the celestial spirits
receive no rewards,&rdquo; Father Benedict said sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass on!&rdquo; ordered the monk.</p>
<p>Realization now came to Penny that in another
moment she too would be expected to drop her contribution
into the fountain. What could she give?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>On her third finger the girl wore a silver colored
ring with a red glass stone. She had won it several
days before at a church party fish pond, and despite
the fact that it obviously had been bought in a dime
store, had kept it.</p>
<p>As Penny&rsquo;s turn came she removed the cheap ring
and let it fall into the basin of the fountain. Keeping
the hood well over her face, she mumbled in a disguised
voice: &ldquo;I give my precious ruby ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessings upon you, my good woman!&rdquo; said the
monk approvingly. &ldquo;The celestial spirits will remember
your generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict now led the procession to the refectory
where supper was to be served.</p>
<p>The room was drafty and barren except for one
long table and benches. Old Julia had set out the
wooden bowls of soup, and crackers, thoughtfully remembering
to set an extra one for Penny. No other
food was in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soup again?&rdquo; asked one of the cult members in
bitter disappointment. &ldquo;We are hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had little more than soup since we came
here!&rdquo; exclaimed another old lady plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so soon forgetting your vows?&rdquo; chided
Father Benedict. &ldquo;Material things have no true
meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grumbling a little, the women sat down at the table
and began to eat. Penny took an empty place near
the door. She tasted the soup and nearly gagged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Father Benedict did not join the group. After
lingering a few minutes he quietly slipped away. This
offered Penny an opportunity to leave without arousing
the monk&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must learn more about that girl who is locked up
here somewhere!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps I can help
her escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still wearing the white robe, Penny started back to
the cloister. The cult ceremony which she had witnessed
greatly disturbed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Benedict is taking unfair advantage of these
people,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;He accepts their jewels
and gives nothing in return. Furthermore, he is
cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices in the cloister directly ahead warned the girl
to proceed cautiously. Keeping close to the wall and
holding her robe tightly about her, she crept closer to
the fountain.</p>
<p>The candles had all been extinguished. However,
Father Benedict and Winkey were there, working by
the light of a lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish out the jewels and be quick about it!&rdquo; the
monk ordered his servant. &ldquo;We must be finished before
they&rsquo;re through in the refectory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback scrambled down into the bowl of
the fountain, and groped with his hands for the trinkets
the cult members had thrown away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did the old lady kick in with the sapphire tonight?&rdquo;
Winkey asked as he worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the monk answered. &ldquo;She sent word that
she was too sick to leave her room! I suspect that girl
put her up to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You goin&rsquo; to let her get by with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk with her later tonight,&rdquo; Father Benedict
said. &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t come across by tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll
find ways to persuade her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been saying that ever since she came here!
If you ask me, we won&rsquo;t never have any luck with her
until we get rid of the girl! She&rsquo;s been a wrench in
the machinery from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are correct, Winkey,&rdquo; sighed the
monk. &ldquo;But I do so dislike violence. Well, if it must
be, so be it. You assigned her to the room with the
canopied bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I locked her in like you said.&rdquo; Winkey, having
gathered all of the trinkets, scrambled out of the stone
basin onto the tiled cloister floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; asked the monk eagerly.</p>
<p>Winkey spread the contributions on a handkerchief.
Father Benedict held the lantern closer to inspect the
articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junk! Trash!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Only the diamond
has any value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this ring?&rdquo; demanded Winkey, picking
up Penny&rsquo;s dime store contribution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glass!&rdquo; In fury, the monk hurled the ring across
the cloister.</p>
<p>Penny suppressed a giggle. But Father Benedict&rsquo;s
next words sent a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This settles it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to the old lady
now! If she refuses to give up the sapphire, then you
know what to do with the girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for the chance!&rdquo; growled the hunchback.
&ldquo;Just say when!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once the girl is where she can&rsquo;t influence the old
lady, we&rsquo;ll have no trouble,&rdquo; the monk continued.
&ldquo;However, we must work fast. After tonight, I have
a feeling we will do well to move our institution elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newspapers are sending reporters around to
ask a lot of questions,&rdquo; agreed Winkey. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
it! If anyone should find out about the crypt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do the worrying,&rdquo; interrupted Father Benedict.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the sapphire and be away before
anyone even sets foot inside the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that Parker girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only a child!&rdquo; the monk scoffed. &ldquo;A very
annoying, nosey one, I grant you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the lantern with them, Father Benedict and
Winkey disappeared in the direction of the monk&rsquo;s
study. Left in darkness, Penny debated her next
action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>If only she could telephone her father or Mr. DeWitt
at the <i>Star</i> office! This, of course, was out of
the question, for the ancient building obviously had no
phone service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might go for help,&rdquo; she reasoned, &ldquo;but a full hour
would be needed for me to reach Riverview and return
with anyone. And what can I prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Penny was convinced Father Benedict and
Winkey were fleecing cult members, she knew the
women voluntarily had given up their jewelery. In
the event police tried to arrest Father Benedict, the
cult members might rise to his defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to have more evidence!&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;The one person who should be able to tell me what
goes on here is that girl who is locked in the chapel
bedroom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stealing across the dark cloister, Penny listened a
moment at the passageway leading to the refectory.
An undercurrent of conversation and the clatter of
tin spoons told her that cult members had not yet
finished the evening repast.</p>
<p>From the map Mr. Eckenrod had shown her, the
girl knew the location of the chapel bedroom. Tiptoeing
down a corridor opening from the cloister, she
came to a massive oaken door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the one,&rdquo; she decided.</p>
<p>Softly she tapped on the panel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; called a startled voice. The words
were so muffled, Penny barely could distinguish them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; replied Penny.</p>
<p>Footsteps pattered across the room. &ldquo;Help me get
out!&rdquo; the imprisoned girl pleaded.</p>
<p>Penny tried the door. As she had expected, it was
locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the key?&rdquo; she called through the panel.
&ldquo;If I can find it, I may be able to get you out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak louder!&rdquo; the girl protested. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny dared raise her voice no higher. She realized
that the heavy paneling deadened sound and made
it impossible to carry on a satisfactory conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key!&rdquo; she called again. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke the words, a board snapped directly
behind her. Penny&rsquo;s heart jumped. Before she could
turn to look over her shoulder, a bony hand reached
out of the darkness and grasped her wrist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>ELEVEN BOWLS</i></h2>
<p>Smothering a scream, Penny twisted around to
see that it was Old Julia who had seized her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped in relief. &ldquo;I thought it was
Winkey or Father Benedict!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go now!&rdquo; the old woman urged her.
&ldquo;<i>Please!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t until I&rsquo;ve helped whoever is locked in here,&rdquo;
Penny replied, gently prying away Julia&rsquo;s fingers
which were cutting into her flesh. &ldquo;Tell me, where
is the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Julia shook her head in a stupid sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to this door,&rdquo; Penny explained patiently.
&ldquo;Where is it kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Benedict,&rdquo; Julia mumbled. &ldquo;No other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s impossible to help the girl without bringing
police!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get out of
here and drive to Riverview! But can I prove anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Old Julia stared blankly at Penny as if not understanding
a word. But she reached out, and taking
hold of the girl&rsquo;s hand, pulled her along the corridor.</p>
<p>Believing that the servant meant to show her a quick
means of exit from the building, Penny willingly followed.</p>
<p>However, Old Julia led her only a few yards before
pausing beside another door. Opening it, she motioned
for Penny to step inside.</p>
<p>The girl saw with some misgiving that Old Julia
expected her to enter what appeared to be a rather
large, empty storage closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to hide,&rdquo; Penny explained thinking
that the old woman had misunderstood. &ldquo;I must
leave here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside!&rdquo; bade Julia insistently. &ldquo;You see! Talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave Penny a little shove into the room and
closed the door.</p>
<p>Only then did the girl realize that she barely had
escaped detection. For, in the corridor, heavy footsteps
now were heard. Standing motionless against
the closet door, she recognized Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice
as he spoke to Julia:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked the servant
harshly. &ldquo;Have I not told you never to come into this
section of the building?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s reply was inaudible. The monk&rsquo;s next
remark warned Penny that she courted detection if she
remained longer in the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come from the refectory,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
counted the soup bowls. There were ten empty and
one barely touched. <i>Who was the eleventh person in
this household that was served tonight?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; moaned Old Julia. &ldquo;I dunno
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said the master coldly, &ldquo;I am inclined
to think you know far more than you let on. Get to
the dishes now! Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently Father Benedict struck or kicked the
woman, for Old Julia uttered a sharp cry of pain.
Her sobs died away as she retreated down the corridor.</p>
<p>After the old woman had gone, Father Benedict
unlocked the door of the bedroom and stepped inside.
By pressing her ear against the closet wall, Penny was
able to hear every word of the ensuing conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Father Benedict to the imprisoned
girl. &ldquo;Are you ready to come to your
senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean, am I willing to sit quietly by and see
you rob my grandmother, the answer is &lsquo;No!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care for your choice of words, my dear,&rdquo;
replied the monk. &ldquo;You are an impertinent child who
must be disciplined.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I get away from here!&rdquo; the girl challenged.
&ldquo;People will learn exactly what&rsquo;s going on in
this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they indeed? So you propose to make trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell what I&rsquo;ve seen. You&rsquo;re only a cheap trickster!
Furthermore, you can&rsquo;t keep me a prisoner in
this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice crackled with
amusement. &ldquo;In this house <i>I am the law</i>! Since you
are in no mood to discuss matters reasonably, I shall
leave you here. Your grandmother, I trust, will display
a more sensible attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave my grandmother alone!&rdquo; the imprisoned
girl cried furiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only after her gems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to cooperate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never fall in with your schemes!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;Let me out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny heard a scuffle and knew that an unsuccessful
attempt had been made to reach the door. As her
own hand groped along the closet wall, it suddenly
encountered a small, circular panel of wood. As she
pushed against it, a crack of light showed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A peephole!&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;Julia knew it was
here! That was what she meant when she said I could
see and listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stealthily, so as to make no sound, she slid the
piece of wood aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Gazing into the semi-dark bedroom, she saw Father
Benedict push the struggling girl backwards onto the
canopied bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have settled your own fate!&rdquo; he said angrily.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll stay here until I find a better place!
Sweet dreams, my little wildcat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quitting the room, he locked the heavy door. The
girl on the bed buried her head in the dusty, scarlet
draperies and began to cry.</p>
<p>Penny waited only until she was certain Father
Benedict was far down the corridor. Then she rapped
softly on the closet wall.</p>
<p>Through the peephole, she saw the girl start violently
and look about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;Over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rapped again, and this time the girl saw the
tiny hole in the wall. Leaping from bed, she came
across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded, unable to see
Penny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend! I&rsquo;m here to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get me out of this room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Benedict seems to have the only key,&rdquo;
Penny told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sneak out of here and telephone
the police. But first, I must know exactly what case
we have against Father Benedict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mean and cruel! He half starves the people
who live here and takes all their money and jewels!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he shut you up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve opposed him. Though I tried hard
to prevent it, he coaxed my grandmother to come to
this horrible place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have either of you been mistreated?&rdquo; Penny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until tonight, Father Benedict favored us above
the other cult members. Of course, that was only because
as yet he hasn&rsquo;t been able to get his thieving
hands on the star sapphire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of the gem, Penny&rsquo;s pulse leaped. No
longer did she doubt that the girl was the missing
Hawthorne heiress sought by Mr. Ayling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one I picked up on the road,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve never told me your name. Is it possible
you&rsquo;re Rhoda&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda Hawthorne,&rdquo; the girl completed for her.
&ldquo;I refused to answer your questions before because I
distrusted everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize you&rsquo;re a true friend&mdash;the only one I have.
Oh, you must get me out of this room quickly! Please
bring police at once!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>A DORMITORY ROOM</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you out of this room somehow,&rdquo; Penny
promised through the peephole. &ldquo;First, before I go
for police, tell me more. Why were you carrying a
suitcase that night Louise and I met you on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was running away,&rdquo; Rhoda Hawthorne replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you returned here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to. When I thought about Grandmother
alone in the clutches of Father Benedict, I knew I
couldn&rsquo;t desert her. She is putty in his hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you bring police here yourself,
Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I prove? Until tonight when Father
Benedict locked me up, I had no real evidence against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now, we haven&rsquo;t very much,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll deny he imprisoned you unless police take him
by surprise and find you here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother will be worrying about me,&rdquo; Rhoda
said anxiously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her room now, sick abed.
I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s from eating such vile food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the doctor think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doctor has seen her. Father Benedict won&rsquo;t
allow anyone to call if he can prevent it. He has only
one thought&mdash;to get his hands on the sapphire and
leave here before police catch up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really convinced he is a crook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it! Grandmother and I met him at
a Florida resort. As soon as he learned about the star
sapphire, he attached himself to us like a leech. Soon
he found out Grandmother is superstitious about the
gem, so he started playing upon her feelings. He told
her about this wretched society of his and painted the
monastery in such glowing colors that Grandmother
became fascinated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he talked her into coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rhoda said bitterly, &ldquo;it was only supposed
to be for a day&rsquo;s visit. But once we were inside the
monastery, we became as prisoners. Letters are confiscated
and there is no telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did get away once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Julia&rsquo;s help&mdash;yes. Only once though. The
place is guarded by Winkey and he is very watchful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, have you seen Mr. Ayling, the insurance
company investigator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling?&rdquo; Rhoda was puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the man who was with me the day you
peeped at us from behind the curtain in Father Benedict&rsquo;s
study,&rdquo; Penny explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! No, only on that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ayling came here to find you and your grandmother.
Then he went to Chicago and hasn&rsquo;t returned.
I&rsquo;m afraid something has happened to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen no one here except members of the society,&rdquo;
Rhoda said. &ldquo;Sometimes though, I wonder
what goes on in the cellar. Once I heard a dreadful
commotion! And the way Julia screams when she is
upset!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a simple soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple perhaps, but she knows more than anyone
else about the real secrets of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of secrets,&rdquo; said Penny hesitantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
wondering what ever became of the star sapphire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe&mdash;at least I think so,&rdquo; Rhoda replied. &ldquo;Not
even Grandmother knows where I have hidden it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no chance Father Benedict can get
his hands on it while I go for police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless he forces me to tell where the gem is
hidden. And I&rsquo;ll die first! But I&rsquo;m afraid he may
torture Grandmother in an attempt to make her reveal
what she doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny prepared to close the peephole. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for
the authorities now as fast as I can,&rdquo; she promised.
&ldquo;Keep up your courage until I return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do be careful,&rdquo; Rhoda warned nervously. &ldquo;If
Father Benedict should catch you trying to escape,
there&rsquo;s no guessing what he would do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny closed the peephole and stole out of the dark
closet. The corridor was deserted.</p>
<p>Retracing her way to the cloister, the girl paused
beside a wall niche a moment as she considered the
safest way to attempt an escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the kitchen window,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;It
worked well enough coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On tiptoe she approached the kitchen, only to halt
as she heard voices. Father Benedict was berating Old
Julia again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>were</i> eleven bowls of soup served!&rdquo; she
heard him insist. &ldquo;Mrs. Hawthorne and her daughter
were not in the dining room. So that makes one extra
person unaccounted for. Julia, someone entered this
house tonight to spy, and you know who the person
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I dunno nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the servant moaned.
&ldquo;Even if you strike me and break my bones I can&rsquo;t
tell you no different!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said the monk harshly.
&ldquo;After a few hours below, perhaps you&rsquo;ll be willing to
talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia uttered a squeal of terror. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take me
down into that awful place where the tombs are!&rdquo; she
pleaded. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me who entered this house tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell, if you quit twisting my arm,&rdquo; Julia sobbed.
&ldquo;Only I didn&rsquo;t want to get her into trouble. She
didn&rsquo;t mean no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that Parker girl!&rdquo; Father Benedict muttered.
&ldquo;She represents the <i>Riverview Star</i>, worse luck!&rdquo;
Giving Julia a hard shake, he demanded: &ldquo;She got in
through the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know nothing, especially when it suits your
purpose!&rdquo; Father Benedict accused her furiously.
&ldquo;Where is the girl now? Did she get away or is she
still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen her a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s heart nearly failed her, for she was certain
Old Julia would reveal that she had hidden in the
closet with the peephole.</p>
<p>To her great relief, the woman replied that she had
taken part in the cult ceremony and then had supped
in the refectory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that before, stupid!&rdquo; Father Benedict
shouted. &ldquo;The girl must still be in the building. I&rsquo;ll
find her, and when I do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Waiting to hear no more, Penny retreated to the
cloister. All candles had been blown out and it was
very dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get out of here now or never!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Father Benedict will start looking for me and he&rsquo;ll
probably order Winkey to watch the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting hurriedly along the cloister, she heard
approaching footsteps. Momentarily confused, she
started up a short, steep stairway to a balcony overlooking
the court.</p>
<p>Belatedly, Penny realized she had turned toward the
dormitories.</p>
<p>Opening from the balcony was a bedroom door
which stood partly ajar.</p>
<p>After listening for a moment, and hearing no movement
inside, she cautiously tiptoed into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A window here may be unlocked,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;If the drop to the ground isn&rsquo;t too far, maybe I can
get out this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny crossed the room, an elderly woman she
had failed to see, suddenly sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, is that you?&rdquo; she asked in a whining voice.
&ldquo;Why have you been gone so long? Oh, I&rsquo;ve been so
worried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, then went over to the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Rhoda, but a friend of hers,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Do you mind if I crawl out through the window?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nailed down and there are bars,&rdquo; the elderly
woman replied. &ldquo;Oh, this is a horrible place! Rhoda
tried to tell me. I wouldn&rsquo;t listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely hearing, Penny ran to the window. As she
pulled aside the dusty velvet draperies, she saw for
herself that the window was guarded by ancient rusty
bars. Everywhere escape seemed cut off!</p>
<p>Turning to the bed again, she observed with some
alarm that the old lady had fallen back on her pillow.
Moonlight flooding in through the diamond-shaped
panes of glass accentuated her pallor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mrs. Hawthorne, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she inquired
gently.</p>
<p>The woman nodded. She coughed several times
and pulled the one thin coverlet closer about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Rhoda?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she
come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not tell her the truth&mdash;that her granddaughter
had been locked in the chapel bedroom by
Father Benedict. Nor could she express the fear that
an even worse fate was in store for the girl unless help
came quickly to the monastery.</p>
<p>As she groped for words, Mrs. Hawthorne suddenly
gasped. Her face became convulsed and she writhed
in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those stomach cramps!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
starting again! Please&mdash;please, a doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Never had Penny felt so helpless as she watched the
poor woman suffer. Mrs. Hawthorne&rsquo;s wrinkled face
broke out in perspiration. She gripped the girl&rsquo;s hand
with a pressure that was painful.</p>
<p>When the cramp had passed, she lay limp and exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a doctor here as soon as I can,&rdquo; Penny
promised. &ldquo;Until then, perhaps a hot water bottle
will help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hot water in the place,&rdquo; Mrs. Hawthorne
mumbled. &ldquo;Oh, if I ever get away from here
alive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Penny suddenly interrupted. She placed
her fingertips on the woman&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps warned her that someone approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Father Benedict!&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t give me away! I must
hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frantically, she looked about for a safe place. The
room had no closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the bed,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Penny wriggled beneath it. Barely had she secreted
herself, than Father Benedict stamped into the bedroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>TRICKERY</i></h2>
<p>Lighting his way with a tall, flickering candle,
Father Benedict walked directly to the bed where
Mrs. Hawthorne lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; he inquired with a show of
sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful,&rdquo; the woman murmured. &ldquo;I must have
a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that a doctor can help you,
my good woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question startled Mrs. Hawthorne. She half-raised
herself from the pillow to stare at the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Surely a
doctor can give me medicine to help these wretched
pains. It is only a stomach disorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Hawthorne, surely you must realize
that your difficulty is not one that a man of medicine
can cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean I have a serious, incurable disease?&rdquo;
the woman gasped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed suffering from a most serious malady
which may take your life,&rdquo; affirmed Father Benedict.
&ldquo;Is it not true that bad fortune has pursued every
owner of the star sapphire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawthorne remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not so?&rdquo; prodded the monk. &ldquo;Think back
over the history of the gem. Even your husband met
with misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you believe my turn has come? Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dislike to distress you,&rdquo; resumed Father Benedict
with malice, &ldquo;but perhaps by warning you I may yet
save your life. Tonight in the crystal globe I saw
your face. A message came that you must dispose of
the star sapphire immediately or you too will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I always have hated and feared the gem,&rdquo; Mrs.
Hawthorne whispered, her lips trembling. &ldquo;You are
right. It has brought only misfortune upon our
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your way is clear. You must dispose of the
sapphire at once&mdash;tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gem is very valuable. You suggest that I
give it to your society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our society,&rdquo; corrected the monk. &ldquo;Once you
have contributed the gem, you will become our most
honored member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gem was left to me in trust for my granddaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You told me yourself you desire that it never
should fall into her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because I fear evil will befall her. I had
planned to sell the gem and place the money in her
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict beat an impatient tattoo with his
foot. &ldquo;The curse would remain,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Only
by giving the gem to a worthy charity can evil be
erased. For your own sake and that of your granddaughter,
I beg of you, give us the sapphire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days ago, I might have considered it,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Hawthorne peevishly. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t even like
this place. It is too much on the order of a prison.
The food is wretched! Tomorrow if I am stronger, I
shall take my granddaughter and leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Father Benedict sneered. &ldquo;For you there
will be no tomorrow. I have seen the face of a corpse
in my glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew that the words shocked Mrs. Hawthorne,
for she heard her draw in her breath sharply.
But the woman retorted with spirit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot frighten me with your predictions!
Rhoda insisted from the first that you are an imposter!
She is right! You&rsquo;ll get no gem from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Father Benedict&rsquo;s voice became mocking.
&ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Placing the candle on the floor close to the bed, he
crossed the room to the old fashioned dresser. One
by one, he began to paw through the drawers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hawthorne. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare
touch my things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Benedict paid her not the slightest heed.
Rapidly he emptied boxes and containers and tossed
clothing in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>With a supreme effort, Mrs. Hawthorne pulled herself
from the bed. Staggering across the floor, she
seized the man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Father Benedict pushed her backwards onto the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a cruel, heartless man!&rdquo; Mrs. Hawthorne
sobbed. The bed shook convulsively beneath her
weight as she lay where Father Benedict had pushed
her.</p>
<p>Penny was sorely tempted to go to the woman&rsquo;s assistance,
but reason told her it would be sheer folly to
betray her presence. Everything depended upon getting
quickly and safely out of the monastery. If she
failed, Father Benedict undoubtedly would escape,
leaving them all locked in the building.</p>
<p>The monk now had finished searching the dresser
and turned his attention to a suitcase. With professional
skill and thoroughness, he ripped open the lining.
Likewise, he explored every garment hem and pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that I ever trusted you!&rdquo; Mrs. Hawthorne
cried bitterly. &ldquo;Oh, I see it all now! From the
very first, you were after the sapphire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I have it too!&rdquo; cried the man in triumph.</p>
<p>His sensitive, exploring fingers had come upon a
small, hard object sewed into the hem of one of Mrs.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s frocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare take the stone!&rdquo; the woman
screamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested as a common thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get out of this room,&rdquo; chuckled the
monk. &ldquo;I intend to lock you in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boast threw Penny into a panic. Not for an
instant did she doubt that Father Benedict would carry
out his threat. If he locked Mrs. Hawthorne in, she
too would be a prisoner!</p>
<p>Penny had no time to plan strategy or reason out the
best course. Already, Father Benedict had removed
the gem from the hem of the garment.</p>
<p>Before he could examine it, or move toward the
door, Penny, with a mighty &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; blew out the
candle.</p>
<p>Scrambling from beneath the bed, she darted to the
door.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, Father Benedict was too slow to
intercept her. She slammed the door in his face, groping
frantically for a key.</p>
<p>Finding none, she knew the monk must have the
only one on his person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fat&rsquo;s in the fire now for sure!&rdquo; she thought in
panic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Penny raced across the balcony and down the stone
steps to the cloister. In this emergency the pillars,
though shadowed, offered no protection whatsoever.
Nor was the dry fountain bed a safe place in which to
hide.</p>
<p>Pounding footsteps warned that there was no time
in which to search for a hideout. The only possible
place was under an old tarpaulin which lay in a heap
on the tiles beside the fountain.</p>
<p>Wriggling beneath the canvas, Penny pulled the
folds over her head.</p>
<p>Barely had she flattened herself on the floor than
Father Benedict pounded into the cloister. So close
did he pass to where she lay, that Penny could hear
his heavy breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where did that brat go?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
here somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk rang a bell which brought Winkey on
the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere for that Parker girl,&rdquo; he
reported before the master could speak. &ldquo;She must
have got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; rasped the monk. &ldquo;She has been hiding in
Mrs. Hawthorne&rsquo;s room! She saw me take the sapphire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you got the gem, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in my hand. Hold your lantern closer and
see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>A long pause followed. Penny guessed that the
two men were inspecting the gem beneath a light. She
was unprepared for the next explosive comment of
Father Benedict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tricked!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the
sapphire Mrs. Hawthorne showed me in Florida! It&rsquo;s
only a cheap imitation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that girl sneaked in and took it herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she did it will be the worse for her! I know
Mrs. Hawthorne brought a genuine sapphire into this
house. Either her granddaughter has it, or this Parker
pest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving here as quickly as we can get away,&rdquo;
Father Benedict said decisively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve over-played
our hand and our luck has run out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re going without the sapphire?&rdquo;
grumbled Winkey. &ldquo;After all our work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the sapphire. First, we must make certain
that Parker girl doesn&rsquo;t slip out of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let the dogs loose in the yard. And the windows
and doors are all locked. If she tries to get out, they&rsquo;ll
set up a yip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! She must be somewhere in the house and
we&rsquo;ll soon find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did she learn, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but enough to jail us both! Go to
my study and destroy all the papers you find there.
Then bring the car to the rear exit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How soon we leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get the sapphire in that time?&rdquo; Winkey
asked doubtfully. &ldquo;What if the old lady holds out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve locked her in her room. Also the other
women. I&rsquo;ll not bother with Mrs. Hawthorne. There
are quicker methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her granddaughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. We&rsquo;ll carry out my original plan. Miss
Rhoda will be glad to talk when I have finished with
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda harsh treatment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you are told!&rdquo; Father Benedict cut in
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, boss,&rdquo; agreed Winkey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure be glad
to shake the dust of this place off my feet. This cult
racket never was in our line. We got in deeper than
we figured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do less talking and more thinking!&rdquo; snapped the
monk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Rhoda and have the sapphire
within fifteen minutes. She&rsquo;s asleep by this time, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked in through the peephole a minute ago,&rdquo;
the hunchback informed. &ldquo;Sleeping like a babe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Father Benedict approved. His final order
sent an icy chill down Penny&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;Give me
your lantern, Winkey. I&rsquo;ll go below now and turn on
the machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>SNATCHED FROM THE FLAMES</i></h2>
<p>From beneath the dusty tarpaulin, Penny had
listened tensely as Father Benedict and Winkey
planned their escape.</p>
<p>She knew that by morning they would be in another
state, beyond reach of Riverview police.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes! The time was so short&mdash;too short
for her to summon authorities even if she could reach
a telephone.</p>
<p>And what of Rhoda in the chapel bedroom? Father
Benedict had spoken of turning on machinery in the
cellar! What machinery did he mean?</p>
<p>A great fear arose within Penny. Rhoda was in
great danger! She must make every effort to save her&mdash;but
how?</p>
<p>Father Benedict and his servant now were leaving
the cloister, walking directly toward the canvas under
which the girl huddled.</p>
<p>Suddenly, to Penny&rsquo;s horror, the dust of the tarpaulin
began to irritate her nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>She fought against an impulse to sneeze but could
not control it. Though she pressed both hands against
her nose, a muffled ker-chew came from beneath the
canvas.</p>
<p>Father Benedict halted, looking sharply about the
darkened cloister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Winkey, flashing his
lantern on the pillars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought someone sneezed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting jumpy, boss,&rdquo; insisted the hunchback.
&ldquo;I sure didn&rsquo;t hear nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that over there by the fountain?&rdquo; Father
Benedict demanded, noticing the tarpaulin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an old piece of canvas. I brought it up from
the basement this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a second, I thought I saw it moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure got the jumps,&rdquo; said Winkey. &ldquo;If you
want me to look for that girl again, I&rsquo;ll give the place
a good going over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no time!&rdquo; the monk decided. &ldquo;As long
as the dogs are loose in the yard, she never can get out
of here without them sounding an alarm. Then we&rsquo;ll
nab her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go after the car and have it at the rear exit before
you&rsquo;re ready to leave,&rdquo; the hunchback promised.
&ldquo;Just be sure you get the sapphire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said Father Benedict grimly. His
voice faded away and Penny knew that the two conspirators
were at last leaving the cloister.</p>
<p>Waiting a moment longer to be certain they would
not change their minds and return, she extricated herself
from the folds of the grimy canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! That was a close call!&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;If what Father Benedict said is true, then I&rsquo;m trapped
in this building along with the others! What a predicament!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny groped for her flashlight and was reassured
to find it still in her pocket. She tested it briefly, then
switched it off again.</p>
<p>Tiptoeing down a long, damp-smelling corridor, she
passed a window. Hopeful that it might be unlocked,
she paused to test it.</p>
<p>Not only was the catch fastened, but the window
also had been nailed. Peering out, she gazed hopefully
toward the distant road. No cars were in sight.
Nor was there a light gleaming in the windows of the
Eckenrod cabin, over the hill.</p>
<p>Instead, Penny saw an ugly hound circling the monastery
grounds, his nose to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winkey already has turned the dogs loose!&rdquo; she
thought in dismay. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a chance to get out of
here quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Switching on her flashlight for an instant, Penny
looked at her wristwatch. In astonishment, she saw
that it was only twenty minutes after nine. She had
assumed the hour to be much later, so many events
had transpired since her arrival at the monastery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could let the <i>Star</i> office know of my predicament!&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Mr. DeWitt won&rsquo;t even
wonder what&rsquo;s become of me before ten o&rsquo;clock. By
that time Father Benedict and Winkey will be miles
from here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main gate of the monastery had been closed
and locked. Penny reasoned that even if she were able
to get out of the building, the dogs would be upon her
before she could scale the high boundary fence, and
make her escape.</p>
<p>As she hesitated at the window, debating whether
or not to smash the glass and take a chance, she heard
the roar of an automobile motor.</p>
<p>For a moment she was hopeful a car was coming
down the road. Then, with a sinking heart she realized
that it was Winkey bringing the big black automobile
from the front of the house to the rear exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minute he and Father Benedict get their thieving
hands on the sapphire, they&rsquo;ll leave here!&rdquo; she
reasoned. &ldquo;Oh, why can&rsquo;t I think of some way to
stop them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had left her own car parked on the road not
far from the monastery. She was hopeful that should
her father or anyone from the newspaper office seek
her, they would see the car and deduct that she was
somewhere inside the ancient building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But no one will come until it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Mrs. Weems probably went to bed early
and didn&rsquo;t tell Dad I came here. Mr. DeWitt won&rsquo;t
think about it until nearly deadline time at the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the hounds kept roaming the grounds.
Penny had never seen such vicious looking animals.</p>
<p>Abandoning all hope of getting away without risking
being torn to pieces, she decided her wisest course
would be to keep hidden until Father Benedict had
driven away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe by staying, I can help Rhoda,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;Father Benedict intends to force her to tell
where the sapphire is hidden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With noiseless tread she started toward the chapel
bedroom which adjoined the church ruins. In passing
the monk&rsquo;s study she noticed that the door stood
slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Peering cautiously in, she saw that the room was in
disarray. All of Father Benedict&rsquo;s clothing, art treasures,
and personal belongings had been removed.
Drawers of the desk had been emptied of their contents.</p>
<p>In the fireplace, flames leaped merrily. Plainly, the
monk had disposed of many papers by consigning them
to the fire.</p>
<p>At the edge of the hearth lay several sheets torn
from a notebook. One of the pages had caught fire
and was burning slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Recognizing it as a sheet listing society contributions,
Penny darted forward and stamped out the
flames.</p>
<p>Only half of the paper had been charred. Many of
the names still could be read. Folding the good section,
she placed it in her coat pocket.</p>
<p>Two other pages which had not caught fire proved
to be blank.</p>
<p>Unable to rescue anything else from the flames,
Penny quitted the study and moved hurriedly toward
the chapel bedroom.</p>
<p>From the dormitories she now could hear muffled
cries and poundings which told her cult members had
discovered themselves locked in their rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get them out without keys,&rdquo; Penny thought.
&ldquo;But if they make enough noise, someone may hear and
come here to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closing of a nearby door brought the girl up
short. As she froze against the passageway wall,
Father Benedict stepped from the closet adjoining the
bedroom where Rhoda was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Instantly Penny guessed that he had been watching
the girl through the peephole.</p>
<p>Father Benedict&rsquo;s satisfaction as he started toward
the ruined church was frightening to behold. Thin
lips were twisted into an ugly smile, and as he passed
within a few feet of where Penny stood he muttered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t">&ldquo;Ah rest!&mdash;no rest but change of place and posture;</p>
<p class="t">Ah sleep&mdash;no sleep but worn-out posture; Nature&rsquo;s swooning;</p>

<br /><i>THE CANOPIED BED</i></h2>
<p>In the chapel bedroom Rhoda Hawthorne had been
greatly cheered to realize that soon she might be freed
from imprisonment.</p>
<p>The brief conversation with Penny through the
closet peephole encouraged her to believe that almost
at once help would come.</p>
<p><i>Penny is proving to be one of the best friends I ever
had and I hardly know her</i>, she thought. <i>I wish now
I had told her everything, especially about the sapphire.</i></p>
<p>With regret the girl recalled how she had rebuffed
Penny and Louise on the occasion when they had offered
her a ride into Riverview.</p>
<p>But at that time she had considered them strangers
who only meant to pry into her affairs. <i>If I had told
everything then, Grandmother and I might have been
spared much suffering</i>, she reflected. <i>I should have
asked them to take me to the police.</i> <i>The worst mistake
of my life was coming back to this horrible place.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Restlessly, Rhoda tramped about the chapel room.
The air was very stuffy and the absence of windows
distressed her. She felt oppressed, as if the four walls
were pressing in upon her.</p>
<p>The room was scantily furnished with only the
huge canopied bed, an old fashioned dresser, and a
table. There were no chairs.</p>
<p>Groping on the dresser, the girl found a stub of a
candle in a holder. At first she could discover no
matches. However, after examining all the dresser
drawers, she came upon one.</p>
<p>Shielding it carefully from draughts, she managed
to light it and ignite the wick of the candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t burn longer than twenty minutes,&rdquo; she
estimated. &ldquo;But by that time, perhaps Penny will be
back here with help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dim light depressed rather than cheered the
girl. Cold currents of air coming from the chinks of
the walls caused the flame to flicker weirdly, and almost
go out.</p>
<p>A grotesque figure weaved like a huge shadow-boxer
on the expanse of smoky plaster. At first,
watching it in fascination, Rhoda could not determine
its cause. Then, with no little relief, she decided it
was a shadow of the bed draperies, moving slightly
with the draughts of cold air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The room had no heat. Soon, against her will,
Rhoda was driven by the chill to seek the warmth of
the canopied bed.</p>
<p>With repugnance she eyed the strange, old-fashioned
piece of furniture which dominated the room.
The bed was wide enough to accommodate three or
four persons comfortably. Tall posters of twisted
wood supported a carved framework to which were
attached dusty, scarlet draperies.</p>
<p>A moth-eaten carpet covered a section of floor directly
beneath the bedstead. Rhoda gave it only a
passing glance and did not think to look under its
curling, frayed edges.</p>
<p>With a shiver of distaste, she pulled aside the draperies
and crawled into the bed. No cover had been
provided, but there were clean sheets. The damp-smelling
spread offered a little relief from the cold.</p>
<p>For some time Rhoda lay staring at the beamed
ceiling and trying in her mind to reconstruct the old
chapel as it might have been in the days when the
monastery was a religious center.</p>
<p>The girl had not the slightest intention of falling
asleep. She felt wide awake, tense in every muscle.
Not a sound escaped her, and every noise seemed intensified.</p>
<p>A board creaked.</p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s nothing</i>, she told herself. <i>All old houses make
strange sounds, especially when a wind is blowing.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Yet disturbing thoughts plagued the girl. What did
Father Benedict intend to do with her? Why had he
locked her in this particular room?</p>
<p>Suddenly Rhoda stiffened and clutched the sheet
convulsively. Was it imagination or had she heard a
low moan?</p>
<p>The sound had seemed to come from beneath the
bed. Half tempted to look beneath the draperies, she
resisted the impulse.</p>
<p><i>I did hear something</i>, she thought. <i>It sounded as if
someone were in pain. And the noise came from the
cellar below!</i></p>
<p>Now to torment the girl came reflections of unexplained
happenings since her arrival at the monastery.
On several nights she had heard disturbances from the
cellar region. Winkey, she knew, made frequent
trips to the crypt upon one pretext or another.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rhoda was startled by a light and repeated
tapping on the wall near the closet peephole.</p>
<p>Certain that it was Penny who had returned, she
leaped out of bed and bounded across the room.</p>
<p>The panel of wood moved back and two eyes peered
in at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Penny?&rdquo; Rhoda whispered eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Rhoda murmured in bitter disappointment.
&ldquo;I hoped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master send you some supper,&rdquo; the servant mumbled.
&ldquo;Bread and coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better you eat and drink,&rdquo; Julia admonished. &ldquo;But
do not sleep. This room is evil&mdash;evil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me!&rdquo; retorted Rhoda, lapsing into
slang. &ldquo;All I want is to get out of here. Julia, let me
free and I&rsquo;ll pay you well! I&rsquo;ll give you anything you
want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know where it is kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master keep keys on him always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would! Can&rsquo;t you trick him or something?&rdquo;
Seeing the old woman&rsquo;s blank stare, Rhoda sighed and
answered her own question. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too much to
expect. But maybe you could slip away from here and
bring help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master never let me out of the house. My place is
in the kitchen. I must go there now&mdash;to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Rhoda checked her. &ldquo;You say Father
Benedict sent some food? On second thought, I&rsquo;ll
take it. He may not give me anything again for a
long while. I expect to be out of here soon, but something
could go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda longed to ask Old Julia if she had seen Penny
or if the girl had escaped. However, knowing that
the old woman might divulge the secret to Father
Benedict, she wisely did not bring up the subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Julia thrust a hard crust of bread in through the
peephole, and then shoved a cup of steaming black
coffee into her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Julia,&rdquo; Rhoda said. &ldquo;I know you mean
well. Working in a place like this isn&rsquo;t your fault.
How did you ever meet Father Benedict anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was an unfortunate one. Apparently,
unpleasant recollections stirred in the woman&rsquo;s brain,
for her eyes became wild. She muttered gibberish
Rhoda could not understand. Then she slammed shut
the peephole.</p>
<p>A moment later, Rhoda heard her footsteps as she
left the closet and retreated down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Julia,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever
come to the same pass she&rsquo;s in? I&rsquo;m sure I will if I
have to spend a night in this torture chamber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shivering, Rhoda climbed back into bed. She bit
into the bread. Discovering it to be moldy, she hurled
it into a far corner of the room.</p>
<p>Rhoda was cold and the hot coffee smelled good.
She sipped it cautiously. The brew tasted peculiar,
sweetish and unlike any coffee she ever had had before.
Nevertheless, it was hot and would warm her
chilled bones perhaps.</p>
<p>She drank the entire cupful and leaned back on the
pillow.</p>
<p><i>What was it Julia said</i>, she mused drowsily. <i>Oh,
yes, I must stay awake. Must stay awake.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>But the warmth of the bed was closing in on her,
inviting her to shut her eyes. Though she fought
against it, she could feel sleep taking possession of her.</p>
<p>She tried to raise her hand and found it too heavy to
lift. Only then did the frightening truth seep into
her mind. She had been drugged! Undoubtedly,
Father Benedict had slipped a heavy sleeping powder
into the coffee! And she stupidly had drunk all of
the brew.</p>
<p>The sound of the peephole panel moving again,
aroused her momentarily from the stupor into which
she rapidly was falling.</p>
<p>Rhoda saw a face at the opening and recognized
Father Benedict. He spoke no word, but gazed at her
with an expression of evil gloating.</p>
<p>The girl tried to move but her limbs seemed paralyzed.
She could not stir.</p>
<p>Then the panel closed and Father Benedict had
gone.</p>
<p>Rhoda fell into a sleep only to be rudely awakened
as the huge bed gave a slight jerk. The stupefied girl
could not think where she was for a moment.</p>
<p>Her head was a-whirl and the room seemed to be
spinning. Like a person taking ether, she felt as if she
were slipping farther and farther away from reality
with each breath.</p>
<p>The canopied bed had come to life and was moving
slowly downward through an opening in the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Rhoda stifled an impulse to laugh. Perspiration
broke out in every pore as she suddenly knew that
it was not a dream nor a horrible imagining. <i>The bed
actually was moving!</i></p>
<p>As she realized her desperate plight, the girl struggled
to free herself from the bed clothing. But her
limbs refused to obey the commands of her mind.
Paralyzed with fright, she tried to scream and made
only a choking sound in her throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>DESCENT INTO THE CRYPT</i></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a great fear had taken possession of
Penny as she saw Father Benedict leave the chapel
bedroom closet and disappear down a corridor leading
into the ruins of the church.</p>
<p>The expression of his face and his evil mutterings
warned her that the man thoroughly enjoyed his role,
despite his insistence that he abhorred violence.</p>
<p>Fearing for Rhoda&rsquo;s safety, Penny waited only until
he had vanished. Then she slipped into the closet
of the bedroom and fumbled for the peephole opening.</p>
<p>She found it and peered anxiously into the darkened
bed chamber. Rhoda was lying on the canopied bed,
apparently sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda!&rdquo; Penny called in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>The girl did not stir.</p>
<p>As Penny whispered the name still louder, she saw
the bed jerk. The floor beneath it began to move
slowly downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>In horror, Penny recalled what Jake Cotton, the
carpenter, had told her about repairing the ancient lift.
Rhoda was being lowered into the crypt below!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Wake up! Quick! Jump
out of bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl seemed to hear for she moved slightly and
made a choking sound in her throat. But she could
not extricate herself from the slowly descending bed.</p>
<p>Numb with despair, Penny saw the girl disappear
beyond view. There was a whine of machinery as the
bed apparently came to a standstill on the subterranean
floor below.</p>
<p>Then after a moment, she heard movement again.
The bed slowly ascended. A glance sufficed to show
Penny that it was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to help her!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That fiend
will torture her into telling where the sapphire is hidden
if I don&rsquo;t think of some scheme for saving her.
But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quitting the closet, Penny sought the same passageway
Father Benedict had taken into the ruined church.</p>
<p>As she cautiously opened the squeaky door, she saw
before her shattered Gothic columns which once had
supported a magnificent roof. Now dim stars cast a
ghostly light over a mass of piled-up rubble.</p>
<p>Walls, however, had proved remarkably sturdy, rising
to a height Penny could not hope to scale. There
were no visible exits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Father Benedict go?&rdquo; she speculated.
&ldquo;Steps must lead down to the crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny flashed her light about, seeking an opening.
Investigating a pile of stone which had tumbled from
an archway, she was elated to find her search at an
end. Behind the piled up rocks, cleverly concealed,
was a vaulted stone passage and stairway leading
down.</p>
<p>Though Penny knew it was highly dangerous to
venture below, she did not hesitate. A step at a time,
and pausing frequently to listen, she stole down toward
the inky blackness of the crypt.</p>
<p>The stone walls on either side of the narrow, curving
stairway were cold and clammy to the touch.
Water dripped from overhead.</p>
<p>Ahead, in a sunken recess amid the stones, the girl
suddenly saw a shadowy figure. Startled, she jerked
to a standstill. Then, observing that the object was
not a human being but a rusty coat of armor, she
breathed easier and went on.</p>
<p>A minute later, as she crept around a turn of the
stairway, terror gripped her at first glimpse of the
dimly lighted burial crypt.</p>
<p>In grim, orderly rows were the elaborately carved
stone sarcophaguses of former residents of the monastery.</p>
<p>Beyond the tombs, backed against a wall, sat Rhoda.
Sleepy-eyed, her hair in disarray, she faced Father
Benedict who held a lighted lantern close to her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Jay Highland had doffed his long robes and stood
revealed in ordinary gray business suit. In his coat
pocket, within easy reach of his right hand, was a
revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; he said, giving Rhoda a hard shake.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only pretending now! The drug in the coffee
was not strong enough to keep you asleep.
Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda stared at him and her eyes widened in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fiend!&rdquo; she accused him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare
touch me! I&rsquo;ll scream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scream at the top of your lungs, my dear. Only
the dead will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dead! Oh!&rdquo; A shudder wracked Rhoda&rsquo;s
thin body as she became aware of the tombs in the
crypt. &ldquo;Why did you bring me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one purpose. I want the sapphire. Hand it
over and you will not be harmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell,&rdquo; Highland rasped, losing all patience.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t all day! You tricked me with that cheap
substitute, and you induced your grandmother to hold
out against me. Now we are through playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a cheap crook!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A crook perhaps,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but hardly cheap.
The sapphire should be worth $50,000 at a conservative
estimate. Now where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never learn from me!&rdquo; Rhoda cried defiantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die before I&rsquo;ll tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! My! Such heroics! However, I think you
will change your mind. Let me show you something,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Setting the lantern on the floor, Highland grasped
Rhoda roughly by the arm and led her to a small doorway
at the far side of the crypt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you see,&rdquo; he purred.</p>
<p>Rhoda drew in her breath sharply and recoiled from
the sight. She was speechless with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I was not thinking of mistreating you&mdash;certainly
not,&rdquo; Highland purred. &ldquo;No, instead we
will bring your aged grandmother down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; Rhoda gasped. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The damp and cold will be bad for her, no doubt,&rdquo;
agreed the imposter. &ldquo;When I saw her tonight, she
seemed to have developed a severe cough. The onset
of pneumonia perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could so easily spare her suffering,&rdquo; continued
the man wickedly. &ldquo;Merely by telling me where you
hid the sapphire. I know your grandmother had it
when she came into this house. But you made off
with it, substituting a paste gem.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, I did hide the gem,&rdquo; Rhoda confessed.
&ldquo;Punish me&mdash;not Grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you tell me where the sapphire is hidden she
shall be brought down here and treated as those others
who defied me.&rdquo; The man jerked his head toward
the room beyond Penny&rsquo;s view. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think about it for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stalling for time, hoping that Parker girl
will bring help!&rdquo; the man accused. From his pocket
he took a stout cord with which he securely bound
Rhoda&rsquo;s hands and feet.</p>
<p>Bracing her back against the wall, he likewise
whipped a handkerchief gag from his clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your last chance,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Will you
tell, or shall I go for your grandmother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell,&rdquo; Rhoda whispered. &ldquo;The gem is a long
ways from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the river docks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the river docks! A likely story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember I ran away?&rdquo; Rhoda asked hurriedly.
&ldquo;I took my suitcase, intending not to come
back. Then for Grandmother&rsquo;s sake I returned. I
was afraid I might never get a chance to sneak my
clothes out again, so I hid the suitcase under a dock by
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gem?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I took it with me when I ran away. It was sewed
in the hem of a blue skirt packed in the suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Highland exclaimed furiously. &ldquo;Of all the
stupid tricks! Where is the suitcase now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still under the dock unless someone has found it.
But it should be there, because I pushed it up high out
of sight beneath the underpinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which dock?&rdquo; the man rasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just at the edge of Riverview. Dock Fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you remember the number!&rdquo; he snapped.
&ldquo;If I fail to find the gem, I&rsquo;ll come back here and make
you pay! You may be certain of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you do come back and that the police are
waiting at the gate!&rdquo; Rhoda retorted. &ldquo;I hope they
put you in prison for the rest of your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up the lantern, Jay Highland started toward
the stairway where Penny crouched. She moved hurriedly
behind the door which opened into the crypt.</p>
<p>Slight as was the sound she made, Highland detected
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he called, holding his lantern high.
&ldquo;Answer or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not doubt that the man would carry out
his threat. Her hand closed on a stone which lay on
a ledge directly behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; she said, exposing herself to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you again!&rdquo; hissed Highland. &ldquo;I might have
known!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Penny let fly the stone. It struck the lantern. The
light went out and oil and flame splattered over the
stone floor.</p>
<p>Knowing it was her only chance to escape, Penny
made a wild dash up the stairs. But she could not
climb swiftly enough.</p>
<p>Jay Highland pounded hard after her. As she
neared the top of the circular steps, he seized her arm
and pulled her backwards.</p>
<p>Penny fought like a tiger to free herself. Together
they stumbled and rolled down the wide stones to the
floor of the crypt. There the man pressed his revolver
hard into the girl&rsquo;s ribs, and she knew the game was up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there!&rdquo; he said, giving her a hard push.
&ldquo;This time you&rsquo;ll stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny reeled backwards into a wall, she heard
the door of the crypt close and lock. With despair
she realized that she too was a prisoner in the chamber
of the dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>CHAMBER OF THE DEAD</i></h2>
<p>Furious at herself because she had been so careless,
Penny quickly tested the door. Finding it securely
fastened as she had known it would be, she
reached for her flashlight. It was missing from her
pocket.</p>
<p>Though she groped about in the darkness, she could
not find it. Giving up, she next turned her attention
to Rhoda Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Thongs about the girl&rsquo;s wrists and ankles had been
loosely tied. In a minute, Penny had set her free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to find a way out of here!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Highland and Winkey probably are driving to the
river dock by this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use trying to get out,&rdquo; Rhoda said despairingly
as she rubbed her bruised wrists. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this
door is the only exit. Look in the adjoining room and
you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Even as Penny started for the inner doorway, she
heard a low moan of pain from someone imprisoned
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rhoda admitted, huddling close
beside Penny. &ldquo;Two men, one of them in frightful
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we set them free? Rhoda, try to find my
flashlight. It fell somewhere near the stairway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Rhoda groped for the flashlight, Penny entered
the inner prison room. Not until she was very
close could she see two men who were chained to a
supporting pillar. Gags covered the mouths of both
victims.</p>
<p>Penny untied the cloths. The first man she thus
freed was someone she never before had seen. But as
she jerked the gag from the lips of the second prisoner,
she was startled to recognize Mr. Ayling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the flesh, or what&rsquo;s left of it,&rdquo; the investigator
attempted to banter. &ldquo;Nice fix for an investigator,
eh? The company probably will give me a merit
award for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were you enticed here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Ayling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
been chained here long, fortunately. My companion,
Joseph Merkill, is in much worse shape. He&rsquo;s been
here a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set him free first,&rdquo; Penny offered. She groped
along the chains which fastened the man to the stone
column. &ldquo;Handcuffs? How can I get them off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, without a key,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ayling.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go for help, or if there&rsquo;s no escape,
wait until someone finds us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not be before morning! Even if police
should come here tonight, they might not see the stairway
to the crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance to break down the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Rhoda and I can try though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda Hawthorne! So it was her voice I heard!
She and her grandmother are imprisoned also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rhoda&rsquo;s with me. Her grandmother, seriously
ill, is locked in a bedroom upstairs. Who is
Mr. Merkill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife is an inmate here,&rdquo; the investigator explained.
&ldquo;Jay Highland&mdash;I know now he&rsquo;s a notorious
jewel thief&mdash;induced Mrs. Merkill to come to the
monastery. After he fleeced her of a diamond necklace,
she smuggled a note out, telling how she was
being mistreated. Her husband, from whom she had
been estranged, decided to investigate. He came here
alone. Discovering what was going on, he threatened
to expose Highland to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Highland tricked me,&rdquo; Mr. Merkill added. &ldquo;He
promised I could take my former wife away and he
would close the monastery. To show there were no
hard feelings, he suggested we have coffee together.
I drank it and became so sleepy I had to go to bed.
That&rsquo;s all I remember until I woke up here, chained
to a post!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been more suspicious of Highland
the first time I met him,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling blamed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go to Chicago?&rdquo; Penny asked as she
worked at the chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now it was Highland who sent me the fake
telegram. He wanted to get me away from here.
While in Chicago, I contacted my home office and obtained
information which convinced me Highland was
a gem thief. So I came here, intending to demand a
police investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met one train,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t arrive until early tonight. When the train
came in, Winkey and Mr. Highland were waiting at
the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, obviously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they told me Mrs. Hawthorne was at the
monastery, seriously sick and wanted to see me at
once. The story fitted with my own conclusion that
despite Highland&rsquo;s previous statements, Mrs. Hawthorne
was here. So I foolishly agreed to accompany
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the car, speeding out here, I realized I was being
foolhardy to return to the monastery without police
escort. At an intersection I tried to get out. Winkey
slugged me. That&rsquo;s the last I knew until I found myself
in this crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Rhoda now groped her way to the door of the inner
prison room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the flashlight but it&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; she reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With or without a light, we must get out of here
and bring the police!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
a chance to free Mr. Ayling and Mr. Merkill ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t a chance to get out of here either&mdash;not
until someone breaks into the house,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling
added. &ldquo;The only door is the one Highland
locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another exit!&rdquo; Penny recalled. &ldquo;Mr.
Eckenrod showed it to me on the map of this old
building. If only we can find it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Filled with hope, she began to grope about the walls
of the inner room. In the semi-darkness, she could
find no break anywhere on the rough stone surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the map, the opening should be along
this wall,&rdquo; she told Rhoda who joined her in the search.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the opening was sealed up years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though half convinced Rhoda was right, Penny
would not give up. Even after her friend had abandoned
the search, she kept tapping the walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>One section, adjoining a large stone tomb, gave off
a hollow sound. But try as she would, Penny could
not find a moveable section of wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; Rhoda demanded as Penny&rsquo;s voice
trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dud I am! I remember now, Mr. Eckenrod
said the hidden passage comes out through a tomb
in the churchyard! So the entrance to the tunnel may
be through this tomb which stands against the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wall did give off a hollow sound when you
tapped it,&rdquo; Rhoda declared, hope reviving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can open the door of the tomb!&rdquo; Mr.
Ayling urged, becoming excited. &ldquo;I have a hunch
you&rsquo;re on the right track!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Penny overcame her own reluctance.
The latch on the big stone door appeared to be locked.
She experimented with it for awhile, and was rewarded
to hear a sharp click. As she pulled on the
door with all her strength, it slowly swung backwards.</p>
<p>Peering in, she saw that the tomb was empty. Also,
the back wall was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance to the passageway!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Rhoda sprang to her feet, Penny hesitated. She
felt it would be cruel to abandon the two men who
remained chained to the column.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go as fast as you can!&rdquo; Mr. Ayling urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
our only hope! If you get out safely, send the police
after Highland and Winkey! Then bring help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hurry!&rdquo; Penny promised.</p>
<p>She grasped Rhoda&rsquo;s trembling hand and started
through the opening into a narrow, low passageway
vaulted over with brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say we&rsquo;ll come out in the churchyard?&rdquo; Rhoda
gasped, huddling close behind her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine so. This passage can&rsquo;t be very long. I
only hope it isn&rsquo;t blocked by a cave-in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their anxiety increased as they inched their way
along. Frequently they were forced to climb over
piles of brick which had fallen from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Once they were certain the passage was completely
blocked. However, Penny pulled aside a mass of
debris, enabling them to climb through and go on.</p>
<p>Then at last the tunnel began to ascend over wet,
slippery ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming out!&rdquo; Penny announced jubilantly.
&ldquo;I can see a crack of light ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few feet farther and the passageway was blocked
by a small stone door. However, dim light shone beneath
it and the girls could feel cold night air on their
cheeks.</p>
<p>Penny tugged at the door and it opened readily.
The pair emerged into another empty tomb. Closing
the stone door carefully behind them, they made their
way out into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still on the grounds!&rdquo; Penny observed in a
hushed voice as she looked alertly about. &ldquo;In the old
graveyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign of Father Benedict or the dogs?&rdquo; Rhoda
whispered nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a trace. The car at the rear of the monastery
is gone! We must get to a telephone as quickly as we
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alternately stumbling over fragments of stone and
mounds of earth, the girls raced for the front gate.
Even as they reached it, a car skidded to a standstill
close beside the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s someone from the <i>Star</i> office!&rdquo; Penny cried,
recognizing one of the newspaper-owned automobiles.</p>
<p>As she struggled with the latch of the big gate, her
father, Jerry Livingston, and Salt Sommers leaped
from the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Penny?&rdquo; called Mr. Parker anxiously.
&ldquo;We were getting mighty worried about you. What
kept you here so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This and that,&rdquo; replied Penny, opening the gate.
&ldquo;It will take too long to tell. We need help and need
it fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As rapidly as she could, she related the essential facts
of Jay Highland&rsquo;s flight, apparently to the river docks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, streak for the nearest phone and turn in a
police alarm!&rdquo; Mr. Parker ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be too late to overtake Highland,&rdquo; Penny
said anxiously. &ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t catch him, the
Hawthorne sapphire will be lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about the suitcase under the dock,&rdquo;
Rhoda interposed. &ldquo;Just get Mr. Ayling, my grandmother
and all those poor folks out of the monastery.
That&rsquo;s the important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt can come back here and wait until police open
up the monastery,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, thinking fast.
&ldquo;Jerry and I will try to pick up Highland&rsquo;s trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send another squad to the river,&rdquo; Salt promised,
starting off at a run toward Vernon Eckenrod&rsquo;s cabin
across the fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highland and Winkey are heading for Dock Fourteen,&rdquo;
Penny said. &ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ll go with you to point it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suitcase really doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Rhoda interrupted
again. &ldquo;You see, the sapphire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, Mr. Parker and Penny were not listening.
Already they were running to the press car. The
publisher started the engine with a roar, and the automobile
raced off to make a quick turn and speed toward
the city.</p>
<p>Disregarding the icy road, Mr. Parker drove at high
speed. Once the car skidded dangerously and barely
missed a ditch.</p>
<p>Soon they approached the outskirts of the city.
Penny watched the riverfront intently. She was the
first to glimpse the familiar long, black automobile
parked close to the dock where Rhoda had hidden her
suitcase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Highland&rsquo;s car!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He and
Winkey must be here! Probably they&rsquo;re under the
dock now! Highland is armed, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our best bet is to try to keep the men in
sight until police catch up with us,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said,
pulling up beside the other car. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re unarmed and
can put up no fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those birds are under the dock on the ice, they&rsquo;re
taking their lives in hand,&rdquo; observed Jerry quietly.
&ldquo;All day, the river&rsquo;s been on the verge of breaking up.
When she goes, it will be with a bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny opened the car door and leaped out. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see anyone down there,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;Do
you suppose they abandoned the car after getting the
suitcase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearful that they had arrived too late, the trio ran
down a boardwalk to the docks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mr. Parker caught Penny by the arm,
restraining her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;See! Just coming
out from under the dock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men, easily recognized as Jay Highland and
Winkey, climbed from beneath the long dock. The
hunchback was burdened with a suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
let them escape with the sapphire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Jerry. &ldquo;I have a hunch we
won&rsquo;t need to do anything except wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, a loud crack not unlike the report
of a gun, sounded along the riverfront. The ice was
breaking up!</p>
<p>Jay Highland and his companion, well aware of
their danger, began to run. Frantically, they sought
a place at which to climb up over the high docks. But
too late. Already the river ice was clearing away.
A great crack appeared directly in front of the two
men.</p>
<p>In panic, they started the other way, only to see
water on all sides. Then the block on which they
stood, began to drift slowly off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; shouted Winkey hoarsely. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In panic, the hunchback turned his eyes shoreward.
Seeing Penny, her father and Jerry on the planking
above, he realized that only arrest faced him if he
were rescued. Fear gave way to blind rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get the sapphire!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see it in the bottom of the river first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising the case high over his head, he hurled it into
the churning water. The next instant the ice beneath
his feet gave way, and both he and his master plunged
into the river!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>THE STAR SAPPHIRE</i></h2>
<p>In a moment, the two men reappeared above the
surface of the water, struggling frantically for grips
on the floating cakes of ice.</p>
<p>Coiled around a dock post lay an old rope which
had not been taken in for the winter. Jerry and Mr.
Parker quickly obtained it and tossed it squarely between
the two men.</p>
<p>Both grasped it and were pulled slowly toward
shore.</p>
<p>Just then a police car drove up at high speed, parking
close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt&rsquo;s telephone call went through!&rdquo; Penny cried,
signaling to the officers who piled out of the car.
&ldquo;The police arrived just when we need them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shivering pair had no opportunity to attempt
escape. As they were pulled out of the water, officers
placed them under arrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right! You&rsquo;ve got us!&rdquo; snarled Winkey. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ll never find the suitcase! It&rsquo;s at the bottom of
the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Jay Highland warned him. &ldquo;Anything
you say will be used against us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazing gloomily at the churning water where the
suitcase had been lost, Penny asked if the river might
not be dragged after the ice had gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll mark the place,&rdquo; an officer promised.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on the case being found though. The
current is fast here. Objects could be carried a long
distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sullen and silent, the two prisoners were removed to
the police car. After consulting with Mr. Parker,
officers agreed to take Highland and Winkey to the
monastery enroute to the lockup. By confronting
them with their victims, it was hoped Winkey at least,
might make damaging statements.</p>
<p>Penny, Jerry, and Mr. Parker followed close behind
as the police car sped to the monastery. Other policemen
had arrived there, summoned by Salt. The front
door had been broken in, and a search was being made
of the building.</p>
<p>Spying Salt at the gate, Penny ran to ask if Mr.
Ayling, Mr. Merkill, and Rhoda&rsquo;s grandmother had
been released.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda&rsquo;s inside now, showing the officers the different
rooms,&rdquo; the photographer explained. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you go on in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will,&rdquo; Penny agreed, starting up the driveway.
&ldquo;I certainly hate to tell her the bad news
though. The sapphire has been lost in the river! It
was in her suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Mr. Parker overtook the girl as she entered
the monastery. Hearing voices in Mr. Highland&rsquo;s
study, they all went there.</p>
<p>A fire had been rebuilt in the grate, and cult members,
released from their rooms, were being herded
into the chamber. Mrs. Hawthorne, looking very ill,
lay on a couch, covered by coats. Beside her, Rhoda
hovered anxiously.</p>
<p>Seeing Penny, the girl crossed the room to whisper:
&ldquo;Grandmother is very sick, but Captain Duveen of the
police force says she will pull through all right.
We&rsquo;ve sent for an ambulance to take her to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have Mr. Ayling and Mr. Merkill been freed yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police are down in the crypt now. Did you catch
Winkey and that cruel Jay Highland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Penny replied, &ldquo;but the story is too long
to tell now. I&rsquo;m afraid though, I have bad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sapphire is gone. Winkey hurled your suitcase
into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda&rsquo;s tense face relaxed into a little smile. &ldquo;Has
that been worrying you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I tried to tell you&mdash;you were in such a hurry
you wouldn&rsquo;t listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried to tell me what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the sapphire wasn&rsquo;t in the suitcase. It&rsquo;s here
in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said you took it with you when
you ran away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Then when I decided to leave my suitcase
under the dock for a quick getaway should I try to
escape from this place later on, I brought the sapphire
back with me. I was afraid to leave it, even sewed up
in a dress hem, for fear someone would find the suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you substituted a fake gem for the real one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Rhoda agreed, &ldquo;because I was certain Highland
sooner or later would attempt to steal the gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what became of the real sapphire? Is it
safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Rhoda said earnestly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we
can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking Penny by the hand, she led her down the
hall to the cloister. At a niche in the wall, she abruptly
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be here, beneath this broken statuette,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;I found a tiny crack in the stone, just
large enough to insert the gem. Lend me a hairpin,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Penny gave her a bobbypin. Rhoda pried beneath
the statuette and presently found the small object for
which she searched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; she announced triumphantly. &ldquo;See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into Penny&rsquo;s hand she dropped a star-shaped gem
which under artificial light had taken on a violet hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By daylight it&rsquo;s even more beautiful,&rdquo; Rhoda explained.
&ldquo;It looks sky blue then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have I seen anything so gorgeous,&rdquo; Penny
murmured in awe. &ldquo;And to think Jay Highland
nearly made off with it! How clever of you to let him
believe it was hidden in the suitcase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was desperate,&rdquo; Rhoda chuckled. &ldquo;Grandfather
willed the sapphire to me, and I intend to keep it
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not afraid of the old superstition, that
harm will befall the owner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; grinned Rhoda. &ldquo;That was
only Grandmother&rsquo;s idea. If ordinary precautions
are taken, the gem always will be safe. After all, it&rsquo;s
highly insured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Mr. Ayling now realizes to his sorrow,&rdquo; added
Penny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if he and Mr. Merkill are out of the
crypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the girls could find the stairway leading
down, policemen appeared, assisting the two men to
the first floor of the monastery. Mr. Ayling, who had
been imprisoned only a short time, was able to walk.
However, it was necessary for officers to carry Mr.
Merkill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Save my wife,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;She is here somewhere.
That crook stole a diamond necklace from
her too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife is safe and in good health,&rdquo; the officer
assured him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found no jewelry though. Describe
the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was being carried outside on an improvised
stretcher, Mr. Merkill gave police a detailed description
of the missing jewelry.</p>
<p>Other persons, members of the cult, also gathered
around to press claims for articles Mr. Highland had
taken from them.</p>
<p>Under guard, the former master of the monastery
and Winkey, were removed from the patrol car to be
confronted with victims they had fleeced. Jay Highland
arrogantly denied he had accepted or stolen any
object of value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no evidence against me,&rdquo; he defied the
group. &ldquo;True, I established a cult here, but entirely
within the law. Not even the sapphire was found in
my possession! These people lie if they say I took
jewelry from them. They were not charged a penny,
even for room and lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you took nothing from them?&rdquo; Penny inquired.
&ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>From her pocket, she removed the charred sheet of
paper rescued from the fireplace. Taking care that
Highland should not get his hands on it, she gave it to
one of the policemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is good evidence!&rdquo; the officer declared.
&ldquo;These birds will talk all right after we get them to
the station!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highland and Winkey were escorted back to the
police car.</p>
<p>Before they could enter it, Mr. Eckenrod hobbled
down the street. He walked with a cane and under
his arm carried a large painting which he was bringing
home from the nearby art museum where it had been
on display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what goes on here?&rdquo; he demanded, pausing
to stare at the prisoners. &ldquo;Winkey and the great
master under arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Told of the events that had led to the apprehension
of the two crooks, he grinned with undisguised delight.
&ldquo;Excellent! Excellent!&rdquo; he chortled. &ldquo;I always
knew these two were criminals! Once they are
convicted in court, I may be able to buy this property
and convert it into a real show place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ll be allowed to complete your paintings
without sneaking into the monastery through the
secret passageway!&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;Showing me
that building map certainly paid dividends!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they give Winkey twenty years,&rdquo; said the
artist. Purposely he spoke so that the hunchback
could hear. &ldquo;The little weasel deserves it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do, eh?&rdquo; snarled Winkey. Breaking away
from two policemen who were shoving him into
the police car, he hurled himself upon the startled
artist.</p>
<p>Before the vicious little man could be pulled off, he
had pummeled Mr. Eckenrod severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Penny asked anxiously as the artist
was helped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Hold this cane and let me at
that treacherous jailbird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officers restrained the excited man as he would have
attacked Winkey. Handcuffs were snapped on the
hunchback&rsquo;s wrists. Just then, Penny uttered a
startled cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Winkey&rsquo;s hump!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
out of shape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the fellow presented a ludicrous appearance
as he stood there, his large hump far over on one
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fake!&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a real hunchback!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the policemen reached out, and with a quick
jerk, ripped the artificial hump from beneath the man&rsquo;s
shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;This hump has
made a safe carryall for the loot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>As Penny, her friends, and cult members gathered
close, the pouch was opened. Inside were found the
diamond necklace stolen from Mrs. Merkill, several
valuable brooches, a black cameo, pearl earrings, an
emerald-cut diamond, and other items.</p>
<p>Eagerly, cult members identified their stolen property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sews up our case,&rdquo; declared one of the officers
in satisfaction. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not need a confession now to
send these two up for a long stretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoners were hustled into the police car,
which set off at top speed for the Riverview Safety
Building. Ambulances began to arrive to remove cult
members deemed in need of medical attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Old Julia?&rdquo; Penny inquired. &ldquo;Where
is she to be sent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be committed to a mental institution for
treatment,&rdquo; Mr. Ayling said regretfully. &ldquo;Perhaps
with proper care, she will fully recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Highland&rsquo;s victims in an earlier deal, I
judge,&rdquo; replied the investigator. &ldquo;Obviously her mind
became unhinged from the cruelty she witnessed and
experienced. Apparently, she has no friends or relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget how she screamed at night,&rdquo; said
Rhoda with a shiver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will I,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
her cry which first drew me to the monastery&mdash;well,
Highland would still be here, ruling supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, along with other members of the strange
household, Old Julia was taken away. One of the
last to be removed was Mrs. Hawthorne, who would
be sent to Riverview Hospital for a complete checkup.</p>
<p>Rhoda, preparing to accompany her grandmother,
hurriedly said goodbye to Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow
and really thank you for all you did tonight,&rdquo;
she promised earnestly. &ldquo;I hope we can be friends
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ayling then tried to express his appreciation to
the Parkers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an investigator, you&rsquo;re the tops,&rdquo; he praised
Penny. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, Jay Highland certainly
would have made off with the sapphire, and our
company would have had to pay plenty. If ever I
can repay the favor, let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reply was cut short by Mr. Parker who glanced
nervously at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to break up this little party, but we
must hot-foot it to the <i>Star</i> office!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Penny, we have barely thirty minutes in which to
catch the three-star edition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; she agreed, looking startled.
&ldquo;I forgot all about the assignment Mr. DeWitt gave me! And
this is a big story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tremendous!&rdquo; her father corrected. &ldquo;Think you
can shoot copy fast, or will you need Jerry to take
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear no S.O.S. call from me,&rdquo; Penny
laughed, her active mind already thinking in terms of
front page headlines. &ldquo;Writing this story will be duck
soup compared to digging up the material. Just lead
me to a typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
